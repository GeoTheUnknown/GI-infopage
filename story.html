            <hr>
            <p>During their travels across the worlds, the Traveler and their twin sibling are confronted by an unknown entity as they were about to depart. In the ensuing battle, the unknown entity seals off the sibling, before doing the same to the Traveler, sealing their powers and putting both of them in Teyvat. The Traveler eventually wakes up after an undisclosed amount of time and proceeds to wander across Teyvat. The Traveler is around Cape Oath when they fish out Paimon from a lake, thus saving her from drowning. Grateful for the rescue, Paimon becomes their travel companion and guide. She suggests they get in contact with The Seven in order to help the Traveler look for their lost sibling.</p>
            <p>Making their way to Starfell Lake, the Traveler touches a Statue of Anemo and they spot a green dragon heading toward a distant forest.Once Paimon and the Traveler leave the forest, the pair are halted by a scout, who introduces herself as the Outrider Knight of Favonius, Amber. Amber offers to escort them to Mondstadt, the City of Freedom, after she deals with a Hilichurl camp nearby, which the traveler and Paimon assist with. Impressed by their actions at the camp, Amber gifts them a Wind Glider. But after a test drive, the dragon the Traveler and Paimon had previously sighted, dubbed "Stormterror" by the locals, starts rampaging throughout the region, unleashing multiple wind storms in the process. The Traveler, with the aid of the stranger (albeit unaware of his presence) is able to drive Stormterror off.</p>
            <p>The confrontation between the Traveler and Stormterror catches the eye of the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius, Kaeya; thus he asks the Outlanders to meet the Acting Grandmaster, Jean, at their primary base of operations. Jean asks them to get a handle on the Ley Line disruptions powering Stormterror from three of the Four Winds' Temples, as prescribed by Lisa, the Knights' Librarian. After dealing with the temples, Paimon suggests that they return to the knights' headquarters to see what they should do next.</p>

            <h3 id="prologueact2" align="center">Act II: For a Tomorrow Without Tears</h3><!--Prologue: Act II-->
            <hr>
             <p>After the Traveler dealt with the Temples, they come back to Mondstadt to report to Jean. They find a masked woman talking to Jean and suggests they kill the dragon to end the problem. Jean dismisses the woman, stating that she has no respect as she knows who Stormterror actually is; Dvalin, one of the Four Winds. Jean then spots the two and explains to them that the woman she spoke to is a Fatui diplomat.</p>
            <p>Regarding the dragon situation, the Traveler remembered the gem they found at the forest earlier, hoping the Knights would know what it is. Lisa tries to study it, but it emits harmful energy towards Vision users, so the Traveler puts it back in their pockets. The Traveler knew the reason, but remains silent as Jean grants the title Honorary Knight to them.</p>
            <p>Paimon knew there was another presence when they found the gem, and subconsciously identified the boy running in the streets as the same person. Tracking his footprints with their Elemental Sight, the stranger sings the song of "Stormterror," identified as Dvalin, and the reason of his rampage. The stranger, Venti recognizes the Traveler.</p>
            <p>The Traveler takes out the gem, but to their surprise, it is purified. Venti then realizes that the Traveler's powers can assist in saving Dvalin but tells them to meet at the place of Mondstadt's Hero, which is the great tree in Windrise. The Traveler arrives at the great tree, but an Eye of the Storm appears and the Traveler is forced to dispatch it first. Venti then explains to the pair that Dvalin is suffering from degradation, which the Abyss Order is taking advantage of. He had tried to cure him earlier, but the Traveler's unexpected arrival ended up poisoning him, although he had recovered by then. Venti then tells them to meet him outside the Favonius Cathedral to get a certain "Holy Lyre der Himmel."</p>
            <p>Entering the Cathedral, Venti asks Sister Gotelinde for the lyre, even revealing himself as his true identity Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, but Gotelinde is not amused and believes he is insane. Venti then suggests the Traveler ask for it, which they do, but Gotelinde tells them that they need papers signed from Jean and the Seneschal and Community Representative to do so, but because they don't have those papers, she does not allow them to take it either.</p>
            <p>The Traveler waits for the guards around the area to drop before sneaking into the vaults to take the lyre. Before they can do so, a Fatui Electro Cicin Mage warps in and takes the lyre, just as a guard enters and spots them. Venti is relaxing outside when he hears Paimon screaming, telling him that they've been busted and need to run. Venti creates wind currents that drop them off near the Angel's Share, where he enters and tells a red-haired man to give them their least conspicuous table. The man is curious but agrees to their request; shortly after, two Knights appear and ask Diluc if he knows where the suspects went; he puts them on a false direction.</p>
            <p>With the Knights gone, Diluc then orders them down to ask what they were doing. Venti introduces the Traveler to Diluc, who recognizes them as the Honorary Knight, calling it a shame they joined. Venti gives a performance to explain the situation to Diluc, who agrees to help them by organizing his contacts and telling them to meet the following night.</p>
            <p>The following night, the pair find that Diluc has contacted Jean; both groups are surprised, but Diluc explains that the Jean before them is just a normal Jean, and not the Acting Grand Master. Jean tells them that she is doing this in private because she has few options as the Acting Grand Master. Likewise, she believes their cause as she is aware of Dvalin's past. Diluc, having managed to interrogate some Fatui beforehand, tells them that the lyre is not in the Goth Grand Hotel, but in a stronghold outside the city premises.</p>
            <p>The party manages to acquire the lyre after defeating several enemies, but not before a Fatui Agents threatens that Signora will end them. The lyre is in relatively poor shape however, so they acquire more Teardrop Crystals and purify them to fully restore the lyre. They then head to Starsnatch Cliff to summon Dvalin and purify him, but an Abyss Mage appears and convinces him otherwise, resulting in Dvalin flying away and the lyre being completely broken.</p>

            <h3 id="prologueact3" align="center">Act III: Song of the Dragon and Freedom</h3><!--Prologue: Act III-->
            <hr>
            <p>Diluc brings some information regarding the Abyss Order to the group, having encountered and slain one of their operatives before. Venti explains that although he is one of The Seven, his long absences have led him to become the weakest of the group, hence why he needs to rely on his people's help.</p>
            <p>Diluc informs the group that his people have tracked the mage down at the winery. After killing it, they note that it dissipated some special energy in the process. Venti realizes that this energy was what had been severing his connection to Dvalin, who has since resided in some ancient ruins. The energy also allowed him to understand the magic powering the barrier sealing the ruins, and he can dispel it. Jean believes that they will need to kill Dvalin in order to bring peace, but Venti states that they can still achieve their original goal due to the Traveler's ability to purify the Teardrop Crystal.</p>
            <p>Arriving outside Stormterror's Lair, they are attacked by a group of Hilichurls. They manage to repel their attackers, with Jean and Venti noting that hilichurls generally avoid elemental areas. Diluc states that the Abyss Order is manipulating them in an attempt to stall, but it will not be enough as Venti dispels the barrier.</p>
            <p>As they navigate the lair and reach the top, Venti realizes they can't get any further, as the ruins are actually part of old Mondstadt, when the Anemo Archon at the time was a tyrant. He refuses to divulge more on the story for the time being. The group note that there is a light actuator and activate it after some struggle. Venti hopes that they can bring Dvalin back to his senses, as he has the freedom to choose whether or not to protect Mondstadt, and that its people never betrayed him in the first place. He then uses his powers to imbue the power with Anemo energy.</<p>
            <p>The Traveler catches up to Dvalin and manages to purge him of the corrupted energy placed by the Abyss Order. Dvalin saves the group, asking Venti why he did not ask him for his protection. Venti states that while he didn't want him to listen to the Abyss Order, he did not necessarily want him to obey Venti, either, and that if he had ordered him to act free, it wouldn't be true freedom. Dvalin then flies off, reassured that no one is after him. Meanwhile, Jean clears the misunderstanding between the people and Dvalin, who they believed came out of nowhere to attack and disappeared just as quickly.</p>
            <p>Returning to the city, they are greeted by Amber, who reveals that while they were dealing with Dvalin, she and the other knights repelled a coordinated hilichurl attack on the city. She wondered where Kaeya had gone during the attack, and she tells them to meet up with her at Good Hunter. At the tavern, they find Kaeya, who tells them that he was suspicious of the attack and remained in the city while everyone else was fighting, intercepting a group of Abyss Order infiltrators and bested them. He learned from them that they are united under a single leader. Spotting Amber arriving, he takes his leave, aware that she is still angry at him for apparently abandoning the knights for a drink.</p>
            <p>Amber is upset at Kaeya's supposed lack of work ethics, before asking the Traveler what they intend to do. Paimon tells her that they'll be travelling to meet The Seven, so Amber wishes them luck on their journey, as they will always be welcome in Mondstadt.</p>
            <p>After eating, she remembers that Jean asked for their presence at the Cathedral regarding the Holy Lyre der Himmel. Making their way to the Cathedral, they find Venti and Jean waiting for them. Jean introduces them to Barbara, the deaconess of the church, who asks for the lyre. The Traveler gives her a damaged lyre, much to her panic. Venti sighs and repairs the lyre, before Barbara takes it and runs off, intending to never let it out of her sights again. Venti chuckles and states that he simply used some magic to make it look as if it was fixed and runs off. The Traveler pursues him outside, upon which a gust of cold air freezes Venti and Paimon, sending the latter flying away.</p>
            <p>Two Fatui Agents appear and restrain the Traveler, while a lady and two Fatui Cicin Electro Mages walk in on the scene. The woman calls Venti a "rodent ruler" and continues to taunt Venti; he in turn returns the favor, enraging her and she plunges her arm into his chest, ripping out his Gnosis. Signora then orders her subordinates to quickly flee the scene before the Knights can arrive; one of the two agents backhands the Traveler, knocking them out cold.</p>
            <p>The Traveler comes to sometime later, where Barbara had found the two. Venti came to first, but her healing had no effect on him, and he abruptly left. Jean appears to understand his intentions, but the Traveler decides to keep quiet for her sake. Arriving at Windrise, the pair find Venti at the great tree and inquire about the Gnosis. Venti, albeit reluctant, explains to them what the Gnosis is. He also explains that the lady that attacked them is Signora, eighth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, people who have been given greater powers by the Tsaritsa. Paimon realizes that the Tsaritsa is also one of The Seven who the Traveler is looking for.</p>
            <p>Venti then explains about the Tsaritsa, stating that although current Seven usually don't get along well, they had still respected each other. He is still surprised by the Tsaritsa's actions, but remarks that a "certain catastrophe" five hundred years ago severed their relationships completely. Venti suggests that they head to Liyue to speak with the Geo Archon, stating that he comes down once every year during the Rite of Descension to determine how the nation will progress. He urges them to head there immediately or they will have to wait another year for the next rite if they miss the Geo Archon.</p>

            <p>After being informed by Venti that Rex Lapis is coming to Liyue this year to begin the Rite of Descension, the Traveler and Paimon quickly rush to Liyue to meet the Geo Archon before he leaves.
            <p>Arriving at Liyue Harbor, the two just arrive in time for the ceremony. As Ningguang summons Rex Lapis, he appears dead before the entire crowd. She orders the Millelith to apprehend all suspects, the Traveler included because they aren't from Liyue and they were too close to the center. The Traveler attempts to sneak out of the area, but on the way, accidentally steps on some glass and alerts the Millelith of their presence. A group of Millelith soon surround the Traveler, who draws their sword out. Before they can fight, a young Hydro user defeats them. Taking them to safety, the young man introduces himself as "Childe", and asks if they met Signora in Mondstadt. The two realize that Childe is also one of the Harbingers and become wary of him, but Childe insists that he is not here to fight and that he will tell them more when they arrive at Northland Bank.</p>
            <p>Upon making their way to the bank, Childe tells them in order to clear their name, they have to get the word of the adepti before the Millieth does, who are rumored to live at Jueyun Karst. He gives them a sigil to prevent the adepti from harming them if they become hostile.</p>
            <p>At Jueyun Karst, the pair meet with the Moon Carver, who notices their sigil and asks what they are doing in the area. The Millelith then arrive, prompting the Moon Carver to ask the Traveler to remove them so they can continue speaking. With the guards routed, the Traveler explains that Rex Lapis was assassinated, much to the adepti's rage. Knowing that the Traveler is innocent of the crimes that the Millelith have accused them of, it tells them to seek out the Cloud Retainer and Mountain Shaper and the Demon Conqueror; the former two residing around Jueyun, and the latter in Wangshu Inn.</p>
            <p>The "Demon Conqueror" the Moon Carver was referring to is a young man named Xiao, who appears to be irritated by their presence and leaves. Speaking to the inn's boss, Verr Goldet, she tells them that Xiao is actually an adepti and enjoys Almond Tofu, leaving the other dish up to them, which they decide to make a Satisfying Salad. She suggests they speak to the chef for the special Almond Tofu. The chef however, is too terrified to create the dish, as a ghost has been haunting the inn. As the pair investigate, Paimon spots the ghost, terrifying the chef even further. With Goldet's advice, the pair follow the ghost, who ends up possessing a decrepit Ruin Hunter. After defeating the Ruin Hunter, the ghost promises to stop haunting the inn if the Traveler continues to play with her. Upon telling the chef of the ghost's promise, he is relieved and creates some Almond Tofu for them.</p>
            <p>With the tofu and salad on hand, they catch up to Xiao. They manage to stop him from leaving by offering him their food, and then tell him about Rex's death, which shocks him. At Paimon's request, he explains to them that the ghost is an innocent spirit who could not move on, so he asked the innkeeper and boss to take care of her for the time being.</p>
            <p>With one of the three adepti found, the Traveler and Paimon begin their search for the Mountain Shaper. Arriving on Mt. Hulao, they find a man begging the adepti to give mercy to him and his brother. Mistaking the two for adepti messengers, he explains to them that they were going up the mountain when his brother became encased in amber. They find his brother and free him from the amber. The Mountain Shaper then appears, angered at the Traveler for freeing a "thief" and disturbing its mountain. Showing it the sigil, it then questions them to their presence and learns from them about Rex's death. It also explains to them that it planted many karst flowers to keep the mountain's tranquility, seeing everyone else as thieves and that those who stepped on the flowers would be encased in amber.</p>
            <p>With the second adepti found, the Cloud Retainer is the last one to be found. Arriving at Mt. Aocang, they find a stone table with food remains, which is meant to be food offered to the adepti. Looking around the area, they place some delicious Matsutake Meat Rolls, Jewelry Soup and Mora Meat on the stone table. Cloud Retainer allows them to enter its residence for the offerings, but will only meet them if they can navigate its domain. They are able to solve the puzzles and meet Cloud Retainer, upon which they explain about Rex's death to it. Cloud Retainer becomes enraged and vows to destroy Liyue for their crimes, but the Traveler manages to calm it down by countering with a "contract" of sorts with the food they had offered it, which it reluctantly accepts.</p>
            <p>Now with all three adepti found, the Traveler returns to Childe and informs them of all that had transpired, who in turn tells them that the Liyue Qixing are refusing to let anyone see Rex's body. Paimon accidentally blurts out that they came to visit The Seven, which Childe immediately takes note of. He tells them that he can help them, but it will be some time in order to meet with his contact.</p>

            <h3 id="ch1act2" align="center">Act II: Farewell, Archaic Lord</h3><!--Chapter I Act II-->
            <hr>
            <p>After returning from Jueyun Karst, the Traveler and Paimon return to the Northland Bank and informed Childe of the adepti. Childe in turn tells them that the Liyue Qixing have hidden the Exuvia, but he has a contact that can get them in. Ekaterina tells them that he is waiting for them at Liuli Pavilion.</p>
            <p>Arriving at the restaurant, Childe introduces the two to Zhongli, a consultant of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Zhongli states that it is his duty to give Rex Lapis a proper farewell, as the adepti are slowly distancing themselves from the rise of mankind. Because of this role, he is capable of bringing the Traveler to the Exuvia. Although suspicious of Childe's intentions, he does not pry further and states that they must go to buy the needed funeral items, the first one being some Noctilucous Jade, having been provided the mora from Childe.</p>
            <p>The three visit the Jade Mystery and inspect Shitou's samples. Although they only needed one sample of jade, Zhongli inexplicably tries to buy all three. However, Paimon stops him and suggests to re-evaluate the purchase. Zhongli is not bothered, but reveals to them how he can tell high-quality jade based on their Pyro affinity. Returning to Shitou, he reluctantly chips off a small sample from all three of his jade. Although the samples are paper-thin, Zhongli states that they can always reinforce the interior with Hydro. The Traveler recalls the massive cooking pot from the Meaty Tribe in Dadaupa Gorge. The three travel there and use the cooking pot to test the jade samples, fending off the angry tribe due to ruining their food.</p>
            <p>With the third sample proving to be of the highest quality, the three return to Shitou and buy the third jade from him. Shitou then inquires as to why they are buying the jade, upon which Zhongli explains to him of Rex's passing. Saddened by the Geo Archon's death, Shitou sells the jade to them at half price, which the Traveler pays off. They then leave the jade for the jewelsmith to forge.</p>
            <p>The next items on Zhongli's list are some perfumes which are created from flowers. They meet with Bolai and ask for some Silk Flowers. Unsurprisingly, Zhongli does not have any mora on him, but after learning why they are buying the flowers, Bolai gives the flowers to them for free. However, he has no idea how to create the perfume, so he suggests speaking to some women around the city for advice, culminating with the Traveler making some with Ying'er's assistance. With all three perfumes on hand, they return to Zhongli and offer the perfumes to the Statue of the Seven outside the harbor.</p>
            <p>Zhongli then tells them that he needs the Cleansing Bell from Madame Ping, but refuses to go with them under the pretense of having some business to attend to. They find Madame Ping in Yujing Terrace, who tells them that the bell is inside her teapot, which is actually a domain, making them realize that she is one of the adepti. They recover the bell and return to Zhongli.</p>
            <p>With the rite nearing completion, Zhongli heads to Granny Shan and takes the kites he had commissioned. Granny Shan is one of the few who appear to care for Liyue's old traditions and appreciates Zhongli's compliments on how well the kites are made. Zhongli now needs some extra work done, so Childe gives the Traveler a bag of mora to get the needed workers. They negotiate with Tic, Tac and Toe to get the requested services, before returning to Childe. Childe allows them to keep the remaining mora in exchange for some information, offering to leave the vaults at the Northland Bank open in return. Before Paimon could answer, the Traveler reflexively refuses to help him, which upsets Childe. Zhongli then walks in, unaware of the conversation, and states that they need to get some Everlasting Incense from Bubu Pharmacy.</p>
            <p>Arriving at the pharmacy, they are greeted by Qiqi. Learning that they want some Everlasting Incense, she requests their prescription, but they are not using it for medicinal purposes. Qiqi appears to be unaware of the Geo Archon's passing, stating that she will give them some if they help her hunt a cocogoat, which they'll need to use the Guizhong Ballista in order to do so. The three head to Mt. Tianheng and find the disabled ballista. Zhongli recalls that there was a supply post nearby with spare parts, which they raid to repair the ballista. Doing so causes some Treasure Hoarders to attack the group, as they had disabled it in order to loot the surrounding area. They defeat the bandits but soon realize that there is no cocogoat, as the ballista would have detected it.</p>
            <p>Returning to the pharmacy, they tell Qiqi that there is no cocogoat. She then takes out her notebook and realizes that she meant coconut milk, and the Traveler begins explaining how coconut milk is created. A man then appears and thanks them for taking care of Qiqi. Introducing himself as Baizhu, he learns that they want some Everlasting Incense and offers to sell it for three million mora, which they can't afford. The Traveler is forced to go to Childe for aid, who is amused by the story and agrees to pay for the incense and set up a supply of coconut milk for the pharmacy. As the group talks, Childe excuses himself and asks Ekaterina if she had heard of anything useful. She tells him that the Qixing have hidden the Exuvia at the Golden House.</p>
            <p>Zhongli asks the Traveler about their opinion collecting the materials for the rite. Regardless of their response, he tells them to meet him at the Third-Round Knockout, a hole-in-the-wall tavern and he has brought mora to pay for the expenses. Arriving at the tavern, Iron Tongue Tian tells them a story about Ningguang just as a young woman appears, having found the Traveler. The woman introduces herself as Ganyu and that Ningguang has extended them an invitation to the Jade Chamber. Zhongli tells them to go, as such invitations are rare, and that he'll be waiting for them at Dihua Marsh when their business with Ningguang is done.</p>

            <h3 id="ch1act3" align="center">Act III: A New Star Approaches</h3><!--Chapter I Act III-->
            <hr>
            <p>Having received an invitation from Ningguang to the Jade Chamber through the Liyue Qixing's emissary, Ganyu, the Traveler and Paimon search for a way there at Mt. Tianheng. They initially find a mechanism and use it, but it does not take them as far as they expected. The Traveler then remembers the Guizhong Ballista that Zhongli had repaired while hunting for the non-existent cocogoat. Arriving at the ruins, they find the Millelith standing guard outside. Paimon panics and believes that Ningguang had lured them into a trap, causing a fight.</p>
            <p>The Traveler defeats the Millelith just as a young woman approaches and asks what is going on. Learning that the two "had designs" on the ballista, the Traveler tells her that they were looking for a way to the Jade Chamber. The woman then introduces herself as Keqing and realizes that they are Ningguang's guests. She tells them that the Millelith are here because someone had magically repaired the ballista in a single day, when it had been standing in disrepair for a long time. Keqing explains how to access the Jade Chamber and departs.</p>
            <p>Paimon then remembers that they still need to give a gift to Ningguang per tradition, and suggests making a tasty slime snack. The Traveler obtains the ingredients and saves a man from Treasure Hoarders. Grateful for the rescue, he sends word back to his boss to allow them to take some items for free. With a gift now in hand, they head to Yuehai Pavilion to ascend to the Jade Chamber, where they are greeted by Ningguang. She gracefully accepts Paimon's gift and offers one in return, before speaking at length about various subjects, including deities, archons, and the Fatui. Paimon suggests looking at the board and finds a special paper, heading to some ruins where they find evidence that the Fatui were researching the Sigils of Permission.</p>
            <p>With the business at the Jade Palace wrapped up, they meet up with Zhongli at Dihua Marsh to continue preparing for the Rite of Parting. Zhongli tells them that they need wild Glaze Lilies. While searching for the flowers, they encounter Ganyu again and discover that she is one of the adepti, having watched over Liyue Harbor since its inception 3,700 years ago. After hearing her thoughts about Rex Lapis' passing, they return to Liyue Harbor, only to find it in chaos.</p>
            <p>The adepti and Qixing have finally confronted each other directly, and at the same time, Ningguang has started cracking down on the Fatui. Zhongli learns from Felix that the Millelith have begun questioning the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor due to their ties with the Fatui, prompting Zhongli to leave the Traveler to assist Hu Tao, but not before telling them to look for Childe.</p>
            <p>Realizing he must have gone to the Golden House in pursuit of the Exuvia's corpse and the Gnosis amidst the chaos, the Traveler heads there and duels him. During the battle, Childe manages to get close to the Exuvia and plunges his hand into its chest, only to come up empty-handed. Childe mistakenly believes they have the Gnosis and demands they relinquish it to him; as the Traveler does not have it, he take it as a refusal and prepares to fight them. During the fight, the Traveler manages to force him to unleash his Delusion and then his Foul Legacy Transformation technique. Despite his advantages, he is ultimately bested and returns to normal. He remarks on how he only realized just now it was impossible for them to have the Gnosis and how Signora's report on them was completely off, but does not inquire into the latter further.</p>
            <p>Switching to his backup plan, despite his distaste for it due to involving innocent bystanders, Childe releases the Sigils of Permission the Fatui replicated to summon Osial, an ancient god that Rex Lapis had sealed underneath Guyun Stone Forest. In the face of this new threat, the adepti and Qixing put aside their differences to fight the common enemy.</p>
            <p>To fight Osial, the group uses the Guizhong Ballistas, with the Cloud Retainer, Mountain Shaper and Moon Carver manning them. As they do so, portals open and release Fatui subordinates onto the platform, intent on destroying the ballistas. Keqing leads the Millelith, while the Traveler is blessed by Xiao, Ganyu and Madame Ping. They manage to repel the Fatui assault, upon which the three adepti on the ballista fire a powerful shot at Osial, but it does not flinch and destroys them and the platform in retaliation. Xiao narrowly saves the Traveler in the process. With no other choice, Ningguang decides to sacrifice her Jade Chamber, using its massive weight to crush the ancient god into the bottom of the ocean.</p>
            <p>With the threat dealt with, the adepti and Qixing settle their differences and the Rite of Parting proceeds as planned. However, this still leaves one question; where is the Geo Archon? The Traveler seeks out Zhongli and finds him at Northland Bank, speaking to none other than Signora and Childe. He reveals himself as not only the Geo Archon but also the one who instigated the entire series of events, starting with his supposed assassination at the Rite of Descension, as a test to see whether Liyue could continue without him. In exchange for a yet-unknown ultimate goal, he forged the "contract to end all contracts" with the Tsaritsa; satisfied with the outcome, he hands his Gnosis to Signora. The two Harbingers and former Archon soon leave the bank.</p>
            <p>Sometime later, the Qixing host the Rite of Parting, which the Traveler attends as they overhear rumors about the battle against Osial, the Fatui's involvement, and hears the official story from the Qixing. Keqing, grateful for the Traveler's assistance in stopping Osial, asks them what they would like as a reward; to her surprise, they simply ask to help put up missing posters for their missing sibling. After talking to several attendees, they speak to Zhongli about Liyue's future. Zhongli, aware of the Traveler's plans, tells them that the next nation, Inazuma, has been sealed off and its archon, "Baal", has issued a Vision Hunt Decree, surmising that his "death" will cause her to advance her plans even further. He tells the Traveler that although the nation may be shut off for the time being, they should not give up and try to find a way in.</p>

            <h3 id="ch1act4" align="center">Act IV: We Will Be Reunited</h3><!--Chapter I Act IV-->
            <hr>
            <h4 align="center">Involuntary Sacrifice</h4>
            <p>After their brief travel with Dainsleif, the Traveler and Paimon head to the Adventurers' Guild Liyue branch, where they find Ganyu and Lan. Ganyu explains that the Treasure Hoarders are attempting a heist on the Abyss Order and came to the Guild to post a commission as the Qixing are too busy, so the Traveler accepts it.</p>
            <p>Heading to the ruins, they make their way inside and find an Defiled Statue of Barbatos hanging upside down, along with the deceased Grand Thief. The area starts shaking soon after, causing Paimon to panic and tell the Traveler to flee. As they near the end, an Abyss Herald intercepts them. After a brief scuffle, the Herald teleports away. </p>
            <h4 align="center">A Herald Without Adherents</h4>
            <p>Outside the ruins, they find Dainsleif, who is surprised to see them. The Traveler then tells him about the inverted statue and the deceased thief. Dainsleif had never heard of an inverted statue before, but due to the Traveler's description of it, knows that it is tied to the Abyss Order in some way. He then proposes to catch up to the Abyss Order, so they find several groups around Jueyun Karst. After defeating them, Dainsleif begins talking about Khaenri'ah, upon which part of the Traveler's memory regarding the fallen nation returns.</p>
            <p>Dainsleif talks more about Khaenri'ah, explaining that it was a nation without gods; not because they were killed, or that they abandoned it, but because it never had one in the first place; human civilization flourished at a very advanced pace; but around five centuries ago, that nation was destroyed by gods. Dainsleif reveals that the Ruin Guards are just the modern names: they were originally called Field Tillers, powerful mortal weapons, and after the destruction of Khaenri'ah they wandered aimlessly spreading throughout all of Teyvat.</p>
            <p>After defeating more Abyss Mages, they find a talisman, which Dainsleif begins to translate. It is revealed that the first phase of the Abyss Order's plan is about Osial, who the Traveler had fought along with the Liyue Qixing and the adepti a while ago. The Abyss Order is planning to attach Osial's limbs to the Defiled Statue, and use the eye of the first Field Tiller in place of the orb that the Statues of The Seven normally hold, to construct a mechanized god.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Dishonorable Trial</h4>
            <p>The Traveler then suggests heading to the Favonius Cathedral to get some information. Dainsleif agrees, but reminds the Traveler not to speak of the missing statue, and he waits outside. Inside, the Traveler finds Barbara, who tells them that they did indeed have one of their statues missing. She also tells them about the "Tyrant's Final Fury", a strange phenomenon in that people who approached Old Mondstadt were attacked by missiles for about a year before they stopped.</p>
            <p>Rosaria then comes in and informs the pair that the Abyss Order is attacking Wolvendom. The Traveler informs Dainsleif of this and they make their way there, where he insists they find Boreas and ask for more information. Arriving at the site where they first met Boreas, they find the Herald once more subjecting him to a corrupting ritual. The Traveler interrupts the ritual and the Herald flees once more. </p>
            <p>Boreas and Razor thank them for the timely rescue. The Traveler then asks Boreas about the Field Tiller. Boreas is not interested in the name, but does tell them that a strange machine entered his territory long ago. Taking the intruder as a challenge, he fought and damaged the machine, which fled the area soon after. </p>
            <h4 align="center">A Soul Set Apart</h4>
            <p>The Traveler and Paimon return to Dainsleif and inform them of Boreas' account. With his and Barbara's information, they conclude that the Field Tiller is the machine tied to the Tyrant's Final Fury. Paimon then realizes that it must be the Weird Statue in Stormterror's Lair. </p>
            <p>Arriving at the domed building, they find the Field Tiller and Dainsleif concludes that it is the one the Abyss Order is seeking. Using his own methods, he extracts its eye out and takes custody of it. To ensure that the Abyss Order cannot restart their plan, he also suggests to destroy the Defiled Statue. </p>
            <p>Returning to the ruins once more, Dainsleif senses the Herald, who attacks them with some mages. As the Herald clashes with the Traveler, it realizes that they are too strong and tries to flee in another portal, but is stopped by Dainsleif, who uses magic to put it into a chokehold. However, he is stopped by a shockwave from someone's sword. </p>
            <p>When the smoke clears out, the Traveler is shocked because the person who interrupted the attack is none other than their sibling. The sibling asks the Traveler why they are with Dainsleif; surprisingly enough, Dainsleif also knows them. The sibling reveals that Dainsleif is the Twilight Sword, one of the royal guards from Khaenri'ah, and he had failed to protect it, being laid upon a curse of immortality and forced to watch his people turn into monsters. </p>
            <p>Although the Traveler insists that the sibling go home with them together, the sibling refuses because they have to fulfill the goal of the Abyss Order, or their war with destiny will not end. They tell them that they will see the truth about the world in their travels, which they had already done. As the Herald conjures a portal, the sibling leaves alongside them. Dainsleif dashes into the portal, with the Traveler trying to follow suit, but it closes on them before they could enter, leaving them depressed. </p>
            <p>As they try to not be depressed about the events, Paimon cheers them back up, telling them that they have some useful information and that they need to keep in mind about Dainsleif as they prepare to go for Inazuma. They recount the events happened so far, and Paimon tells the Traveler to prove their sibling what they're made of and the resolve to travel around Teyvat to discover the truth. </p>

            <h4 align="center">A Path Through the Storm</h4>
            <p>While overlooking Liyue Harbor, the Traveler takes a moment to stop and think over the recent revelations about their sibling and the Abyss Order. Paimon comforts and encourages them to keep going, and the Traveler regains their resolve to look for and confront the Unknown God and demand answers. They try to brainstorm over ways to get into their next destination, Inazuma, when they remember the one person they've met who has not only been to Inazuma, but is Inazuman herself — Atsuko.</p>
            <p>They head back in to Liyue Harbor to meet with Atsuko and attempt to ask her how to get into Inazuma. While she is able to give them an answer, she also warns them of the danger of the trip. She explains that the storm is not the only thing to worry about, as they will also have to worry about the strict isolationist policies and the authorities who will be hot on their trail if they're discovered. When the Traveler refuses to be swayed by her warnings, she relents and refers them to Beidou, who may know how to break through the storm owing to her vast experience on the seas. Wasting no time, the Traveler heads to Guyun Stone Forest where the Alcor, The Crux Fleet's flagship, is anchored.</p>
            <p>Arriving at the ship, they find Beidou with an unknown man. Beidou recognizes the Traveler, having heard of their exploits from Ningguang and introduces the man as Kazuha, a temporary crewmember. She mistakenly assumes that the Traveler has approached her to join "The Crux Clash," a Vision-less martial arts tournament she holds for renowned fighters. When Paimon explains they're not there for the tournament, she tries to encourage them to join anyway by revealing that the prize for this tournament is a Masterless Vision provided by Kazuha, who hopes that the tournament winner will be able to reawaken it. However, the Traveler is not interested in the Vision, and is only looking for a way to get to Inazuma. Hearing that, Beidou changes gears and decides to change the prize — if the Traveler wins the tournament, they will be able to choose between two prizes, the Masterless Vision or a ride to Inazuma on the Alcor. The Traveler finally agrees, and heads to the arena to sign up.</p>
            <p>At the arena, Paimon suggests they scope out their initial competition before signing up. However, after speaking to a few other contestants, they realize they won't have much competition. With newfound confidence, they head to the desk where a member of the crew, Zhuhan, is in charge of registering the combatants. She is shocked to see the traveler who helped Liyue fight off an ancient god joining the tournament, which also gathers attention from the other competitors and spectators. After proving that they don't have a Vision and listing a few of their achievements so far for the sake of formality, the Traveler is finally registered and ready to fight the first round.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Crux Clash</h4>
            <p>The first opponent, Jinyou, is easily no match for the Traveler, even without the use of their elemental powers. Beidou, impressed with their skills, states that since putting them in, more people are coming to join, hoping to face off against them. She decides to put them straight through to the semi-finals so that they don't need to waste their energy on fights well below their skill level.</p>
            <p>The next opponent, Rongshi, is more of a challenge and the Traveler barely prevails against him. After he's defeated, Rongshi explains that he had no interest in the prize, and instead joined to pit himself against other strong fighters. He humbly accepts his defeat and even asks the Traveler to spar with him again in the future.</p>
            <p>Rongshi is unable to tell them much about their next opponent other than that they are fast and nimble, so they decide to ask around. Unfortunately, they don't learn much and decide to go to Beidou for more information. Beidou only reiterates their opponent's speed, but Kazuha offers to give them more information if they follow him to a quieter place to talk.</p>
            <p>Once there, Kazuha reveals that he already knows about the Traveler's ability to harness the power of the elements without a Vision. As the Traveler is unable to answer his questions about how he is able to do so, he instead tests their skills by having them fight some Slimes. After the fight, Kazuha assures them that their opponent's speed will stand no chance against their skill, and gives them more tips about their opponent's fighting style. After telling them a bit more about Inazuma and the Electro Archon, they go back to the arena to await the final match.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Follow the Wind</h4>
            <p>At the arena, the final match is about to start, but the challenger is a no-show, much to Beidou's irritation. Kazuha then senses something is wrong and the group checks on the box, where the Vision is missing. He offers to look for it since it was his responsibility. The Traveler accompanies him and Kazuha reveals that he knows where the culprit is going and who they are.</p>
            <p>The culprit is Fei the Flyer, a Treasure Hoarder, who is surprised they managed to track him. He reveals that he signed up at the tournament and had intended to win fair and square, but after seeing the Traveler defeat Rongshi, he knew he had no chance in beating them. Initially refusing to hand the Vision, he fights them, only to be bested. Kazuha threatens to kill Fei, but after nothing happens, he changes his mind and lets the Treasure Hoarder leave, confiscating the Vision.</p>
            <p>Kazuha reveals that he had been aware of the theft all along and hoped that Fei would have been able to resonate with the Vision, as the gods typically grant them to those who prove great strength and resilience. He then asks the Traveler to do so, but they are unable to either, so Kazuha continues to hold it. Paimon asks him why he is so obsessed with the Vision, and Kazuha reveals that when the Raiden Shogun enacted the Vision Hunt Decree, his friend, another Vision bearer, challenged her, only to die in the ensuing duel. Kazuha, who had just arrived and witnessed the final moments of the duel, snatched the Vision and fled from his pursuers, hoping to keep the hope alive that his friend had. He had heard rumors of Masterless Visions reawakening in his travels, and as such, was looking for someone to do so.</p>
            <p>Returning to the arena, the two learn from Zhuhan that Beidou was summoned by Ningguang regarding the tournament, and is filled in on the details by Kazuha. By default, Fei is disqualified and the Traveler is crowned the champion. Kazuha warns the Traveler that the journey to Inazuma will be treacherous, even more so once they set foot on the closed nation. He also tells them that the Alcor needs to supply themselves for the trip and that they will be notified once ready; in the meantime, he intends to travel across Liyue to see if someone can reawaken the Vision, hoping the two of them will have enjoy their journeys.</p>

            <h4 align="center">Setting Sail</h4>
            <p>Wondering on the status of the Alcor, the Traveler and Paimon head to Katheryne at Liyue's guild branch. And just then, Sea Drake arrives, having been sent by Beidou to tell them that they are ready to set sail. Katheryne says her farewells, but tells them that she would be waiting for them at Narukami Island.</p>
            <p>Beidou disembarks with the Traveler and Paimon at Ritou before being greeted by Thoma, her business partner. The Captain leaves the pair to his care, since she can't stay around for too long with Kazuha, who is still a wanted fugitive. Thoma later helps them pass the processing center to avoid suspicion given the impossible request and the ridiculous amount of Mora.</p>
            <p>After processing, Thoma explains that there are some inspectors who try to increase the price of processing as much as possible for outlanders, who cannot leave the nation due to the Sakoku Decree. As such, the foreigners formed the International Trade Association to survive. He also learns they intend to meet with the Raiden Shogun, stating that he can help them do so, but in turn they will need to help out others first, starting with the said association.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Confessions of an Outlander</h4>
            <p>Thoma's friend and the President of the Trade Association, Kurisu, is surprised to see new outlanders, and explains that since he and the foreigners have been stuck in the port, the Kanjou Commission has been bleeding them dry with absurd taxes. They originally had to pay Mora, but they suddenly changed it to Crystal Marrow, which almost none of the Trade had heard of. Even worse, their attempts to look for it causes the item to skyrocket in both taxes and price from the only source available, leaving them in danger of homelessness. The Traveler offers to assist, with Kurisu accepting as they aren't affiliated and as a newcomer, the vendor might drop his guard.</p>
            <p>The merchant, Werner, realizes they were sent by the Trade Association and refuses to negotiate. Returning to Thoma, he tells them that Werner hails from Mondstadt and found a "patron" after leaving the association. Giving an item from both Mondstadt and Liyue, the vendor gives in to his emotions and admits that he is playing a scheme by Keijirou and his companions; they buy all of the Crystal Marrow and give it to him, who sells the excess back to the association at profit and the cycle repeats; despite his role in the plot, he is barely paid. Tracking him down, they spot Keijirou burying a ledger. Werner tells them to send it to Kurisu, as he is too afraid to confront the President of the Trade.</p>
            <p>Keijirou demands payment from the Trade when the Traveler and Paimon arrive and expose his wrongdoings. Cornered, the corrupt officer offers to give his spare Marrows to keep the case quiet, but Harrison, angered at the injustice, demands more and calls the commissioner by name, prompting a passing Katsuie to order the merchants arrested. Before that could happen, Thoma intervenes and hands them a card from the Yashiro Commission and a peculiar ornate fan, making Katsuie decides to drop the incident to avoid having a problem with "her".</p>
            <p>Taking them aside, Thoma explains that he is actually an attendant of the Kamisato Clan, taking care of the clan's eldest daughter, Kamisato Ayaka, the Shirasagi Himegimi. Ayaka has heard of their feats and is expecting their arrival, hoping that they can change the tides — the Vision Hunt Decree. Although the Traveler is uninterested in helping, insist on pursuing their goal, Thoma agrees to help them meet the Electro Archon anyway and ask to meet them at Komore Teahouse, but the pair realizes they can't leave Ritou, believed it must be part of the test.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Ritou Escape Plan</h4>
            <p>Since they still need a travel permit to leave Ritou, Paimon suggests they head to the Kanjou office to meet with the Commissioner, Hiiragi Shinsuke. Upon arriving at his residence, he walks out and notices the Traveler. Hiiragi agrees to help but only after the Traveler agrees to complete an unbearable request; the Traveler initially is flabbergasted and finds it too strenuous, but considers it after spotting a woman behind Hiiragi who silently nods her head, indicating that the Traveler should take on the offer.</p>
            <p>Leaving the office, they secretly received a letter from Miss Hiiragi asking for a letter sent to Kujou Kamaji of the Tenryou Commission and reveals that a few days before their arrival, an arrogant-sounding woman arrived and conspired with Shinsuke to keep the Traveler on Ritou. The following day, she heads to a supply convoy and uses her position to force the two escort guards to accept the Traveler as her bodyguard. On the way, they fight off bandits, and arriving at the destination, Chisato returns to Ritou, wishing them luck and reminding them to bring the letter to Kamaji for their permit.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Three Wishes</h4>
            <p>Arriving at the teahouse, the pair are greeted by Thoma inside, who pulls a prank on them by pretending to be the dog Taroumaru. Thoma apologizes for the test, as it was necessary, if they can "change the lightning." Thoma promises to bring them to the Kamisato residence after seeing the Statue of the Omnipresent God, still under construction.</p>
            <p>There, Thoma explains about how the Raiden Shogun declared the Vision Hunt Decree and that the "gems" embedded on the statue are the seized Visions. The Traveler touches the statue and suffers a headache as they hear the aspirations of the people, surprising Thoma and Paimon. Later at the Kamisato residence, where Ayaka anticipated their arrival. She hopes that the Traveler would assist in the fight against the Shogun, but they continue to refuse. Ayaka compromises with them, promising to bring them to the Shogun if they visit three people who had their Vision confiscated from them.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Meaning of Meaningless Waiting</h4>
            <p>At the first location, Konda Village, the Traveler finds an old couple, Mahiru and Kenjirou trying to persuade a younger man Tejima not to leave. Inquiring the man, Tejima was a samurai who become Visionless. With his Vision gone, he has had trouble remembering why he stayed at the village for so long and is intending to leave and become a wandering samurai. The pair offer to help refresh his memory, which he accepts. They find a paper that explains why he stayed at the village; to wait for his lover, but she never came. After the events, Tejima then chooses to remain in the village to wait for her, although wondering if she would ever come.</p>
            <h4 align="center">To Treat the Well-Meaning Well</h4>
            <p>The next person is a samurai from the Tenryou Commission who had their Vision confiscated, found in Inazuma City. As Paimon wonders why the Shogunate would take action against one of their own, they hear a commotion breaking out. Two men are accusing a samurai, Kurosawa Kyounosuke, of withholding emergency rations from them. He had originally given it to them on request, but now is withholding them for no reason.</p>
            <p>Speaking to the Samurai, he tells them that despite enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree, he was told that he had been "slacking off" to the point that he even disappointed the Raiden Shogun, causing him to lose his Vision. He had forgotten what he had done every month, and is not even aware of the rations themselves. Just recently, he was pursuing some Treasure Hoarders when the men had stopped him and asks the Traveler to track them down, believing they would have stolen the rations.</p>
            <p>They find the Treasure Hoarders nearby, who are commenting over their recent plunders. After beating them up, Tadao tries to recruit them, but the Traveler refuses and inquires about Kurosawa. Tadao states that Kurosawa's house had nothing apart from a box, which he offers in return for his and his men's freedom. Opening the box, they are surprised to find that it only contains IOUs, all addressed to a Miss Aoi of Tsukumomono Groceries, and the Hoarder gang leaves.</p>
            <p>Heading to Aoi, she tells them that Kurosawa always bought foodstuffs regularly from her store to give to the people, even taking on debt to ensure their well-being. She also recalls that he had a prized sword which she would accept as payment for his debts. Returning to Kurosawa once more, he learns the truth and explains the history of his sword to them. He also threatened the rioting men with his sword, even though he felt himself unable to go through with the act, and is troubled that he cannot be good or bad, wondering what to do.</p>
            <h4 align="center">A Swordmaster's Path Is Paved With Broken Blades</h4>
            <p>With the second person dealt with, they head to the final client, a swordmaster known for the Meikyou Shisui Art who is also in the city. Outside the dojo, they find two disciples worried about their sensei's well-being. The Traveler make a ruse that they had come to learn from their master seeing that the disciples were wary beyond reason. Junya apologizes, stating that with all the trouble recently, he is on high alert. Their sensei, Domon, is believed to be possessed and is recovering, explaining his history and that he took a turn for the worse when his Vision was taken. As such, they have hired shrine maidens from the Grand Narukami Shrine to exorcise the demon possessing him.</p>
            <p>While the exorcism is in motion, Paimon spots a suspicious person nearby and the Traveler pursues them. The man is surprised they caught up so fast, believing Domon had improved their skills in the past few years. He reveals himself to be Anzai, the oldest disciple of his sensei in the art until Domon surpassed both him and their master. When he heard Domon had lost his mind, he came back to see if the rumors were true — to his surprise, Domon called out for him. He then tells them to head back to the dojo as he suspects the ritual is about to end.</p>
            <p>The exorcism has ended, but the maiden, Inagi Hotomi, had not sensed any demon possessing Domon. However, she is unsure if another form of demon has possessed him, and tells them that Lady Yae has taken notice of the unusual case. She tells them to come to the shrine tomorrow and leaves. At the shrine, Yae inspects Domon and states that he is not possessed, much to the disciples' surprise. The Vision gave Domon immense aspirations, and when it was seized, the gruesome fact that he had destroyed the aspirations of his past deeds, rushed back into him, turning him maniacal. Anzai then walks in, much to Domon's surprise and tells him that he had accepted the fact that his aspirations were gone and had "passed" them to Domon. Now that Domon's aspirations are gone, he urges them to pass it to his disciples, who are still willing to learn from him. Domon eventually realizes the meaning behind Anzai's words and promises to, thanking Yae for her help with his disciples before leaving.</p>
            <p>Yae then speaks with the Traveler, having anticipated their arrival, albeit premature — nonetheless, she mysteriously states that she has high expectations for them and they better not disappoint her. Paimon then suggests they return to Ayaka.</p>
            <h4 align="center">A Flower Blooms In Prison</h4>
            <p>Ayaka introduces herself in person this time and explains the reasoning to why she sent them to three former Vision bearers — seeing the suffering first hand, making the Traveler finally agrees to help. Heading to the teahouse, Ayaka explains about the resistance's actions. One of their operations, creating fake Visions, was halted when the craftsman responsible for making them, Master Masakatsu, had been arrested. Ayaka wishes to break him out, but cannot risk either herself or Thoma to lead the operation — therefore, the Traveler would do the job. She states that there will be more people willing to help and sends them to the Naganohara Fireworks.</p>
            <p>There, they find members of the Tenryou Commission threaten a Vision bearer. Before the Traveler could intervene, a woman grabs their attention. Paimon scolds them for not interfering as the samurai take the Vision. Apparently it was all a ruse and the woman, Yoimiya, is known by the people of Inazuma for her fireworks — despite this, she was not exempt, but managed to elude confiscation due to Masakatsu's craftsmanship. Yoimiya learns from Paimon that the two were sent by Ayaka to break Masakatsu out.</p>
            <p>Arriving at the police station, the Traveler and Yoimiya enter through a backdoor, upon which she leaves them to finish her "gift". The three eventually arrive at the main holding cell where the guards are torturing Masakatsu. But before they can do anything, Kujou Sara comes in, checks on Masakatsu and then scolds the guards for torture. She soon hears Yoimiya's footsteps and orders the guards to investigate. Yoimiya then sets off her "gift" to distract the guards as they rescue Masakatsu. Sara then spots them in the act, but allows them to leave as she knows Masakatsu needs urgent care, but warns the craftsman that she'll bring him back in when he's recovered.</p>
            <p>Yoimiya and Masakatsu thank the Traveler and Paimon, who then return to the teahouse to inform Ayaka of the good news. Thoma also states that the Tenryou Commission has been tasked with a "ceremony" of sorts and suggests they spend the next few days relaxing, which Ayaka accepts. After having a hot pot "game", the group separates. </p>

            <h3 id="ch2act2" align="center">Act II: Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow</h3><!--Chapter II Act II-->
            <hr>
            <h4 align="center">Amidst Stormy Judgment</h4>
            <p>The following day after their "hot pot" game, the Traveler decides to return to the Komore Teahouse. They think that Thoma is once again trying to pull a prank on them; however, it is revealed to be no prank as Ayaka walks in and asks them if they've seen him. Replying with 'no', Ayaka confirms her fears; according to her, Thoma may have been taken away by the Tenryou Commission. She explains that Thoma would be the 100th victim of the Vision Hunt Decree. Ayaka attempts to go herself, but the Traveler and Paimon stops her, saying doing so would make her and the entire Yashiro Commission enemies of the Raiden Shogun. Thus, they offer to go themselves to save Thoma.</p>
            <p>The Traveler arrives in time to the ceremony to see Thoma, but also the Raiden Shogun in person. The Raiden Shogun pulls Thoma's Vision, but before she could inlay it into the statue, the Traveler intercepts and grabs it, knocking the two guards restraining Thoma out in the process. The Shogun is impressed at their ability to manipulate elements without a Vision and drags them into an alternate realm for battle, using it as "verification" purposes.</p>
            <p>Despite the Traveler's powers, the sheer strength of the Shogun leaves them incapacitated as the realm around them disappears. The Shogun attempts to finish the Traveler off with the Musou no Hitotachi, but before she could land the killing blow, Thoma breaks free of his bindings and throws a nearby spear at her, forcing her to cancel the attack, generating a massive gust that sends the Traveler flying at Thoma, who catches them, and then they flee. The guards wonder who the Traveler was, while the Shogun issues an arrest warrant on the two, stating that she will strike twice against the Traveler next time.</p>
            <p>A fair distance away in the city, Thoma tells the Traveler that he will need to go into hiding for a good period of time and they have to take the next step themselves. He suggests they find the Watatsumi Army, believing them to be the best choice to take them in from the arrest warrant that is bound to be declared on them soon. He also admits that the Yashiro Commission is not on good terms with the resistance, but the Traveler, being a unique outlier, should be able to convince them. As he is not sure where the resistance may be, he suggests that they gather intelligence on the way there and wishes them luck.</p>
            <h4 align="center">In the Name of the Resistance</h4>
            <p>Waving goodbye, the Traveler and Paimon decide to find the resistance, starting at Tatarasuna. Along the way, they overhear a pair of Shogunate soldiers, Takayama and Ishihara, saying that the resistance is being pushed near Musoujin Gorge. Paimon suggests they verify the information before ensuring the resistance is based at the gorge. Continuing on, they find a pair of travelers — Sakamoto and Jiichirou. Sakamoto wishes to go to Higi Village, believing it to be safer than the warzone, while Jiichirou had just been to Nazuchi Beach, complaining it was complete chaos there. Paimon then suggests they check the beach.</p>
            <p>Upon arrival, they notice a resistance soldier that is under attack by the Shogunate soldiers. After confronting them and rescuing the resistance soldier, he introduces himself as Teppei of the Gobius Platoon. He explains that the General of the resistance, Gorou, is looking for more like-minded people, and that the Traveler's presence would be a help for the resistance as they can use the elements without a Vision. Teppei then explains that the Shogun's goal is the Eternity, and as such, they have the help of Kujou Sara, who controls an exceptionally strong force.</p>
            <p>Arriving at the camp, Teppei introduces the Traveler to Gorou, telling him about how they saved him and used the elements without a Vision. Gorou asks them if they are certain they wish to join as they will have to sacrifice their lives if need be. The Traveler tells him about the Vision Hunt Ceremony, upon which Gorou states he heard there was a disturbance in the ceremony despite the Raiden Shogun's presence. They then tell him that they were the ones who did so, much to his surprise, but he then recalls a bounty paper from a defeated Shogunate samurai that matches their description, so he welcomes them into their ranks.</p>
            <p>Teppei offers to introduce the Traveler to the Resistance camp. They go to the hospital camp to introduce them to Teppei's friends. Teppei requests the Traveler to pick out materials that can be used as medicine. After they collect the materials, Tokuda suggests that the Traveler checks out the archery camp, to which they agree to. Once there, Teppei introduces the Traveler to more of his friends, and they request the Traveler to give them a demonstration on how to use a bow.</p>
            <p>Proving their archery skill, Hisahiko and Shouji thank the Traveler. They explain that they used to have a peaceful life, and war was the last thing on their mind, but that had changed with the Vision Hunt Decree. They had decided to join the Resistance in order to prove their worth, speculating if it is possible for those without Visions to fight. All of a sudden, a messenger arrives, informing them that the Shogunate army has breached the camp.</p>
            <p>After repelling the attackers, Teppei comments that the Shogunate's forces shouldn't have been able to get this far in and concludes that there must be a traitor in the army. The messenger then returns and informs them that some of the walls have been damaged, which may be why the Shogunate army decided to attack. Apart from tasking them to repair the walls, he also suggests they double the sentries to avoid such attacks in the future before leaving. Teppei then starts a contest with the Traveler to see who can repair the wall faster.</p>
            <p>Upon repairing the walls, Teppei has a sense of relief, though he complains about having to do logistics work again when he was looking forward to the combat after being transferred to the front line. He is insistent about being on the front line to show his worth in battle, as every member knows the risks they are facing. They go to report to Gorou, but he is nowhere to be found. Kaida informs them that they have just caught wind of a massive Shogunate army led by Sara advancing on the main front, warranting Gorou's attention. He is worried that the resistance will be routed and have to retreat once more, causing morale to deplete further. The Traveler and Teppei offer to head to the front to assist in any way possible.</p>
            <p>They arrive to a confrontation between the Shogunate and the Resistance, with Sara complaining that the leader of the resistance has been causing a lot of trouble for the Shogun. She offers Gorou a deal; knowing that the Traveler has sought refuge in the resistance, she states that she will order a ceasefire if the Resistance gives the Traveler to her, but Gorou refuses, not intending to betray one of their own.</p>
            <p>When the Traveler arrives, Sara immediately recognizes them and applauds them for the bravery. She offers a deal for the Traveler; to represent the resistance in a fight of honor. Gorou explains that both sides choose their finest warriors for a match of single combat, and victory could constitute an important boost to the weaker side's morale. Despite Gorou's insistence that she is trying to capture them, the Traveler accepts her offer. Rather than facing them head on, Sara instead has them battle some Shogunate soldiers, all of whom they defeat.</p>
            <p>Sara is impressed by their strength and concludes the duel, initiating the actual battle. The Shogunate forces inflict considerable casualties against the resistance, much to Gorou's frustration as he orders them to hold the line. In the midst of the battle, Hydro bubbles appear, signaling the arrival of Sangonomiya Kokomi, the resistance leader. With a large group of mercenaries, along with both Beidou and Kazuha, the new reinforcements relieve the pressure on the battlefield and turn the tide. A frustrated Sara then orders the Shogunate forces to retreat.</p>
            <p>Kokomi introduces herself to the Traveler, admitting she hadn't expected them to join the Resistance, and asks the Traveler about their current plans. Having no immediate plan of action, Kokomi requests to continue the conservation at the Shrine of Sangonomiya. Teppei offers to come, as he knows Watatsumi Island very well. She informs Gorou that she is not done with her plans yet but assures him that the mercenaries and Kazuha will remain at the camp to discourage future Shogunate attacks. She also tells the Traveler she will be waiting for them at Watatsumi Island and to inform Teppei when they're ready to do so as she leaves.</p>

            <h3 id="ch2act3" align="center">Act III: Omnipresence Over Mortals</h3><!--Chapter II Act III-->
            <hr>
            <h4 align="center">Sword, Fish, Resistance</h4>
            <p>Meeting up with Teppei, he tells the Traveler that their appointment with Sangonomiya Kokomi is coming and sails them to Watatsumi Island. Arriving at Bourou Village, Teppei suddenly remembers about the appointment as he puts himself at ease. The two head there and find Kokomi talking with Ookubo Daisuke, the former telling the latter to keep food supplies steady and that the army is expanding. As the two walk in, Daisuke is surprised to see Teppei, and even moreso when he recognizes the Traveler as the new recruit everyone is talking about. Daisuke then excuses himself.</p>
            <p>Teppei then asks Kokomi what she meant about the expanding army, and she tells the two that a short while ago, someone sent her a letter promising her men and supplies as long as they continued their fight against the Shogunate. While suspicious of their true motives, she nonetheless chose to ally with them for the badly needed supplies. Seeing the Traveler's potential, she also promotes them to captain of the Swordfish II spec ops group, much to Teppei's bewilderment. Kokomi hands them an appointment letter so they could get their squad's trust, while explaining that some ronin have been causing trouble for the rearguard and need to be exterminated. As Teppei asks what he could do, Kokomi promises to find something for him.</p>
            <p>They find two members, who inspect the letter. They are skeptical of their prowess, so they have them take out a group of ronin nearby, as they don't have time for a duel. After clearing the ronin, they introduce themselves as Koutoku and Yoshihisa. Koutoku cedes position of captain to the Traveler, who then asks them if there are any other ronin to deal with. Yoshihisa states that there is a stronghold on the eastern side of the island, and Paimon encourages the Traveler to clear them out so they can't hamper the war efforts. At the area, there are three camps, and the group separates to clear them all out at once before they could scatter and regroup. With the island now secure, the Traveler returns to Kokomi for further instruction.</p>
            <p>Kokomi thanks them for their efforts and gives them a new assignment. The ruins of Fort Mumei during the Archon Wars have been used as a supply transit between Watatsumi and Tatarasuna, but recently, supplies have gone missing and there were no reports of danger in the area. She tasks them with investigating what is going on there, but allows them to take a few days' respite. The Traveler then asks where Teppei went, and she tells them that she sent him on a naval battle against the Shogun's Navy per his wishes to fight on the front lines. The Traveler trains with their unit and meets Teppei a few days later. He is excited to see them doing well and also reveals that due to his participation in the naval battle, he has now been appointed captain of the newly formed Herring I unit. As the two share some small talk, a member of Herring I calls him over for their new mission. The Traveler and Paimon then go off to complete their own assignment.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Those Who Yearn for the Gods' Gaze</h4>
            <p>The Traveler and Paimon arrive at Fort Mumei and find some suspicious Electro Monuments. Upon activating the monuments, a Thunderhelm Lawachurl ambushes them but is easily slain by the Traveler. Paimon wonders about its appearance and the 'creepy atmosphere', but before she can urge the Traveler to go back, a slightly worse for wear and coughing Teppei arrives. He excuses his state as probably just a cold he caught at sea, and explains that he was returning from delivering supplies to the front line and stopped by the area to check out for threats. Paimon asks him if he thinks there's something strange about the area, to which he agrees and says there's something off about it. He believes it may be due to the Tatarigami being more present due to the close proximity to the remains of Orobaxi, the guardian deity of the Watatsumi ancestors who was slain by the Raiden Shogun after it invaded Yashiori Island. Furthermore, Teppei also mentions a rumor that the Shogun also lost something dear to her during the Archon War. However, he also explains that the animosity between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate is not the reason why the resistance was formed. Rather, because the Shogun stopped Orobaxi when it attacked civilization, they must now take a stand against the shogun who has turned against the people with the Vision Hunt Decree. With the short history lesson over, they split up so Teppei can take a breather and the Traveler can report back to Kokomi.</p>
            <p>At the shrine, the pair find Kokomi and Gorou having a serious discussion about strange symptoms that have been found among some of the resistance's soldiers. These soldiers were ambitious types who had acquired some kind of secret weapon from their new sponsor. Gorou managed to acquire one, which the Traveler immediately recognizes as a Fatui Delusion. They are shocked to realize that their secretive ally may actually be the Fatui, but Kokomi is more concerned with stopping the use of Delusions within the group due to the risky side effects. She and Gorou decide to go to the camp themselves, while the Traveler and Paimon rush to check in on Teppei after remembering his state earlier.</p>
            <p>When they finally find him, Teppei seems to have aged significantly in the short time they were away. He tells them about the contributions he has made to the war effort and says that he could do even more if he was stronger. When the Traveler asks him about his 'secret weapon', he reveals that he got it from some people who claimed to be with their sponsor shortly after the Traveler became the captain of Swordfish II. They claimed that it would answer his call so long as he has the will to be stronger, like a Vision. The Traveler corrects him and tells him the weapon was actually a Delusion, which drains the user's life force. Teppei realizes that this must be the reason he's been feeling more tired and having a sense of dread and laments that he didn't receive the favor of the gods. Despite seemingly accepting his fate, he still tries to comfort the Traveler by saying he'll be right as rain after he takes a rest, even telling to bring back their uniforms once they're ready so they can change together. As Teppei's breathing gets weaker and weaker before he passes, the Traveler vows revenge on the Fatui.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Delusion</h4>
            <p>Kokomi and Gorou arrive outside the training ground and meet with the Traveler. She has enacted a ban on the Delusions; while most only had a loss of vitality, a few others had died. Gorou states that the soldiers will continue to use the Delusions despite the ban. Kokomi decides to head to the front lines to address the situation, but the Traveler insists on going in her place to get revenge on the Fatui. Kokomi is concerned for their safety, believing that they would be unable to handle the situation alone and suggests forming a strike team as support. Gorou advises her against this, as the reckless confiscation of the Delusions are likely to get the Fatui's attention. Kokomi brainstorms where the Fatui are making the Delusions, as the Sakoku Decree would prevent them from importing them into Inazuma. She then guesses that the factory is somewhere on Yashiori Island and the Traveler immediately makes their way there.</p>
            <p>As the Traveler clears the facility, they realize that the Kanjou Commission has been collaborating with them due to the Crystal Marrow stocks inside. The Fatui desperately try to hold them off for the "Lord Harbinger". The Harbinger is soon revealed to be Scaramouche, but he claims that he is not the mastermind of the events in Inazuma, only simply following orders. He states that the Delusions make for a powerful market for the weak, such as Teppei, which angers the Traveler. The Traveler then collapse, with Scaramouche revealing that the facility is infested with the energy of the old gods who sense their anger. Before the Traveler blacks out, they spot Yae Miko confronting Scaramouche.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Servant's Path</h4>
            <p>The Traveler comes to at the Grand Narukami Shrine. Miko explains that the Traveler is the only one who can save Inazuma and Ei, the Raiden Shogun. She states that the person they saw at the ceremony is a vessel and that Ei is actually inside the sword used in the Musou no Hitotachi art. But because the Traveler has once manifested inside her realm, Miko believes that Ei has taken an interest in them. She also believes that if they can defeat Ei in the plane, Ei would repeal the Vision Hunt Decree. Thus, she sends them off for specialized training.</p>
            <p>Arriving at an abandoned shrine at the base of the mountain, Miko reveals a mechanism which reproduces the Shogun's attacks from her memory. Miko also reveals herself to be a fox servant of Ei, but because she believes Ei is acting childish, it is up to her to bring Ei back to reality. After finishing the training, Miko states that she has a guest to greet at the shrine. The guest is none other than Kujou Sara, who immediately orders the Traveler's arrest, but Miko reminds her that no violence is allowed at the shrine. Sara begrudgingly orders her troops to stand down and leave per Miko's request. Miko tells her that the Vision Hunt Decree is a lie and that the Fatui are pulling the strings, but Sara is not convinced, so Miko states that she'll give her the evidence in three days. Sara accepts, stating that if the evidence is nonexistent or false, Miko will have to apologize for her baseless slander and that the Traveler would be coming with her.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Proof of Guilt</h4>
            <p>As Sara leaves, Miko reveals that they can get their evidence by "awakening the professional" at Chinju Forest. The professional is none other than Sayu, and Miko tells Paimon that she is a member of the Shuumatsuban. Miko tells the Traveler to go into town to collect evidence, which they are unsure of, but she reminds them of the Yashiro Commission. They arrive at Komore Teahouse and find Thoma still hiding inside, asking them to bring Kamisato Ayaka to the teahouse. Once she arrives, the Traveler explains their activities. Ayaka found it odd that the Shogun never inquired about the war against the resistance, but only Kujou Takayuki has access to the documents. Even then, it is heavily guarded, but a distraction should help, upon which Thoma remembers about Yoimiya. They meet with Yoimiya and ask for a firework; she gives them an extra-large one and asks them to let it know how it went.</p>
            <p>The Traveler meets up with Sayu before setting the fireworks off by the Statue of the Omnipresent God and fleeing back to teahouse. Sayu soon returns, having taken everything she deemed suspicious before going off to sleep. As Ayaka looks at the papers, she finds a document for the latest war report and another for collaboration with the Fatui. She gives them to the Traveler and Paimon tells them to return to the shrine.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage</h4>
            <p>Returning to the shrine, Sara asks Miko for the evidence. The Traveler arrives with them, which Sara reads. She is disgusted to see that there is no mention of the war in the official report, and after looking at the collaboration letter, becomes enraged as she storms off to confront her adoptive father. The Traveler and Paimon prepare to follow her, but Miko states that if they want to reach Ei, they'll have to recreate the scenario as with their first encounter. She also gives them an omamori as a farewell gift, telling them to use it wisely.</p>
            <p>While in town, Sara discovers the two have followed her. She nonetheless accepts them as witnesses until she gets answers from her adoptive father, but warns them that if they've deceived her she'll charge them with an extra crime. Heading inside, she forcefully removes all of the guards, prompting Takayuki to come out and scold her. Sara asks him if what she saw is true, which he does not deny, stating that the Fatui were means to preserve the clan's power, as they would be no match for the Shogun herself. He also reveals that she is meeting with Signora at Tenshukaku, much to the Traveler and Paimon's surprise as they realize she is the mastermind behind everything in Inazuma.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Duel Before the Throne</h4>
            <p>Heading into Tenshukaku, the Traveler finds that Sara has dispatched of all of the guards. Heading inside, they find the Shogun, Signora, and an unconscious Sara. The Shogun chastises Signora for punishing one of her own, while the Traveler informs her of the Fatui's misdeeds. Signora feigns innocence in the accusations and reminds the Traveler that they're still a wanted criminal. They counter this by calling a duel before the throne, which the Shogun accepts. Signora, confident that she would win, becomes shocked when she ends up losing. The Shogun then walks towards the two, prompting the Traveler to raise their sword, but she ignores them and heads for Signora. The Harbinger protests that she has diplomatic immunity, but her plea falls on deaf ears as the Shogun executes her with the Musou no Hitotachi. She then allows the Traveler to leave Tenshukaku alive.</p>
            <p>As the Traveler leaves Tenshukaku, they get some headaches while Paimon is worried over their silence. Upon exiting the grounds, they find the resistance, along with Gorou and Kazuha, who then stop in horror as they spot the Shogun's sigil behind them as she prepares emerge and strike them down. Kazuha, with the assistance of his friend's Vision, manages to dart to them and block the attack before he is knocked away. The rest of the group charges at the Shogun, but knowing that they are no match for her, the Traveler attacks the Shogun first, arriving at Ei's plane.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Omnipresent God</h4>
            <p>Inside the realm, Ei reveals that she allows the Vision Hunt Decree to go on despite knowing of the Fatui's involvement as it poses no threat to her ideals of eternity. The Traveler states that they are here to demolish her notions, which Ei takes as a challenge to a duel and accepts. During the duel, Ei enacts the Vision Hunt Decree, but the Traveler remembers the omamori Miko gave them and takes it out, causing her to appear in the plane. Ei is surprised to see Miko and her involvement in the plan. Miko informs the Traveler to tap into the Visions embedded on the statue, allowing them to repel the decree and defeat Ei. Ei concedes defeat but initially maintains that she is doing the right thing, to which Miko replies that she is doing more harm than good. Ei then decides to rescind the Vision Hunt Decree.</p>
            <p>After learning the full extent of the damage caused by the Fatui, Ei has the Shogun return the seized Visions back to their rightful owners provided that they could be found or were alive. Ei also has both the Kanjou and Tenryou Commissoners arrested for their roles in the Fatui plot.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Wishes</h4>
            <p>Returning to the shrine, the Traveler meets with Miko, who requested them to the shrine. Paimon is glad that they stopped the Fatui and prevented them from getting their hands on a Gnosis, but she reveals that she gave it to Scaramouche in return for the Traveler's safety. Miko explains that prior to her meditation, Ei gave the Gnosis to her as she only saw it as a sign of conflict and she had cut off all ties with Celestia. In return for saving Inazuma and knowing that their journey is not over, she allows them to ask several questions. She promises to help them look for their sibling and advises that they go to Sumeru next. </p>

            <hr>
            <p>Arriving at Liyue's Adventurers' Guild branch, Paimon and the Traveler greet Katheryne. Katheryne is in a cheery mood and tells the Traveler that they will have an unexpected reunion, later explaining to Paimon that she had just returned from Inazuma's Grand Narukami Shrine. The words remind the Traveler of their sibling, much to Paimon's concern. Paimon then asks Katheryne if she has a commission for them, which she confirms. A man named Yuehui placed a commission regarding The Chasm and she wishes them luck, while also remarking that they're plunging into the abyss.</p>
            <p>On the way to the mine, the two are greeted by some Millelith guards who recognize them due to their involvement in the battle against Beisht. They let them pass and they find Yuehui inside. Yuehui explains to them that the Qixing reopened the Chasm and he and his men were the first to get a permit to mine on the outskirts. While one of his miners was on a break, he saw some hilichurls walk straight into the Chasm in a trance and they never returned. As such, his men are concerned about what's going on inside and that it's beginning to hamper mining operations. Paimon suggests considering the offer, but the Traveler takes it right away, as they suspect that the Abyss Order must be involved in some manner.</p>
            <p>After unlocking access to the Chasm and unlocking a few mysteries, the Traveler and Paimon discover some underground ruins similar to the Defiled Statue. Just then, Dainsleif runs in and both groups are surprised as they never expected to run into each other. Dainsleif explains to the two that he was on the trail of another Abyss Herald when it retreated through the portals. He also discovered that the Abyss Order directs where the portal goes. As such, when he ran into the portal during their encounter with their sibling, he ended up in Stormterror's Lair. The Traveler inquires as to his identity, in which he reveals a bit about Khaenri'ah but is reluctant to do so. They then notice a lit brazier nearby and decide to investigate.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Grave of the Guarded</h4>
            <p>Upon arriving at the site, they find evidence of hilichurl activity. After Paimon remarks about the evidence, Dainsleif asks them what they were doing in the Chasm. Paimon then tells him that the Traveler was commissioned to investigate hilichurl activity. Dainsleif then remarks that the area appears to lessen the curse and that the hilichurls coming here are expecting to die, as they too also hail from Khaenri'ah and the masks are used to hide their true faces.</p>
            <p>Just then, two Black Serpent Knights attack the trio, which they repel. Dainsleif explains that the Knights were originally men under his command, but have since been consumed by the curse and lost all honor. Paimon and the Traveler then spot another Knight which doesn't attack them, but instead leaves when Dainsleif refocuses on it. He wonders if the Knight had somehow remembered him despite lacking "it."</p>
            <p>Arriving at the entrance to the inverted ruins, Dainsleif dispels a barrier to gain access, stating that the building might have belonged to a civilization older than his. They find some Black Serpent Knights inside and eliminate them, discovering that they were guarding some hilichurls who were aware they were going to die, not being related to the Abyss Order. More Black Serpent Knights then appear, but the Knight from before comes in and orders them to retreat; before Dainsleif could act any further, the special Knight had also left. Dainsleif then suspects that the Knight must be "Halfdan," a promising young man and an elite in the Royal Guard. Dainsleif recalls that during the fall of Khaenri'ah, he had given Halfdan the order to "inform all Black Serpent Knights to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs," and believes that despite their curse, they still remember their final orders. Dainsleif then reminds them they need to climb the summit, but the Knights should no longer obstruct them.</p>
            <p>Once they arrive at the summit, they find a water structure which Dainsleif recognizes as the source of weakening the curse. Halfdan then arrives and urges them to follow him.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Memories of Inteyvat</h4>
            <p>As they follow Halfdan's path, they come across several Hilichurl settlements on the way. At the last site, Dainsleif asks them to investigate everything. The Traveler finds a flower which Dainsleif recognizes as an Inteyvat, a flower that wilts upon two weeks of blooming but hardens if taken out of Khaenri'ah. The Traveler then recalls a flashback in which they witness their sibling talking to an Abyss Herald about their plan to remove the curse and rebuild Khaenri'ah regardless of how slim the odds were. Dainsleif considers the plan folly due to his stance that the curse is vital despite loathing it and that they should stop the Abyss Order as it would tarnish Halfdan and the other Knights' legacies. The Traveler chooses to assist him due to their growing stances on the world.</p>
            <p>On the way out of the settlement, a bright light flashes and the Abyss Herald warps in and admits that it had made a mistake in not overseeing where Dainsleif would have gone. It insists that the Abyss Order is doing a service for the hilichurls, but Dainsleif dismisses it as folly. They kill the Herald after a short battle, upon which Dainsleif tells them to hurry back to the temple to destroy the device.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Black Serpent Knights' Glory</h4>
            <p>Making their way to the summit, they spot an Abyss Lector trying to attempt the ritual that ends up bringing suffering to the hilichurls, Knights, and Dainsleif. Dainsleif asks the Traveler to stop the device, but before they could act, Halfdan runs in and covers it with his body, temporarily stopping the device. Dainsleif is impressed by Halfdan's soul as he had expected him to turn to ash on contact. The Traveler then kills the Lector and offers to take the device's power in Halfdan's stead, but Dainsleif tells them that there's several smaller devices powering it and sends them off to destroy them.</p>
            <p>After destroying the four devices, they return to the center where they confirm that Halfdan is dead. As Dainsleif walks away, Halfdan's soul appears and the two salute each other. Dainsleif reassures Halfdan that Khaenri'ah still stands and thanks him for his service. After his soul passes on, Dainsleif tells the Traveler that the Abyss Order's operation is still ongoing and that they'll need to pick a side soon, while Paimon suggests he take a short moment of respite as the device had harmed him significantly. </p>

            <hr>
            <h4 align="center">A Forest of Change</h4>
            <p>Arriving at the border between Liyue and Sumeru, the Traveler and Paimon decide to look for Lesser Lord Kusanali to seek answers from them. Paimon remarks that the Dendro Archon is different from the Unknown God that abducted their sibling. As they walk into the forest, they see a scholar and ask for instructions; however, she ignores them, so they decide to follow her instead.</p>
            <p>There, they find the scholar in a cave lighting up some incense, which causes the Traveler to faint. The Traveler hallucinates a massive, glowing, white tree under a red sky and walks towards it, subsequently hearing an unknown voice say, "...World... Forget me..." The Traveler then wakes up in a hut and is greeted by Collei. She and her master, Tighnari, found them while on patrol and the latter explained to Paimon what happened to them. After dealing with a separate issue, Tighnari talks with the Traveler and upon learning what they saw, decides to have them stay at Gandharva Ville until they recover. As Tighnari leaves, the Traveler and Paimon have a private discussion, with the Traveler havinwithheld some of the information as they believed Tighnari was not honest with them. Therefore, they decide to speak with Collei first.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Further Observation</h4>
            <p>The next day, they see Collei and Tighnari, the latter going out on a dangerous patrol and leaving the former behind to handle some other tasks. The Traveler and Paimon decide to help, so Tighnari asks Collei to take them. Collei checks the lamps on the route to the ville before arriving at the Statue of The Seven, where she briefly talks about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and Lesser Lord Kusanali. She then asks if they know Amber, and is delighted when they confirm they do, as Amber had helped her immensely during her time in Mondstadt and have kept in touch via letters, hence why she guessed if they did know her. Collei then asks why they want to know about the Dendro Archon and learns of their reason of visiting Sumeru before they go to clean the statue, while she goes to check the forest canopy.</p>
            <p>After cleaning the statue, Collei treats the two to some food and drinks. Paimon then asks about Tighnari's strictness, to which Collei states that he's actually kindhearted, as he refused to accept a position at Sumeru Akademiya to stay at the forest. When Collei begins recalling how Paimon was in a panic over the Traveler, Paimon becomes angered and tries to touch Collei, only for her to suddenly snap. She abruptly apologizes before running off, much to their confusion.</p>
            <p>Returning to the ville, the two learn from Nasrin that Collei went to her room, so they decide to wait the following day to speak with her.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Chronic Illness</h4>
            <p>The following day, the two decide to look for Collei, only to find Tighnari who explains that Collei is not feeling well. Paimon wonders if her action yesterday caused it, but Tighnari states that she had been fighting it off for quite some time and had neglected her health after meeting the two. After moving away from her hut, Tighnari tells them he had learned of their actions across Teyvat and begins to explain Collei's story as she wanted to. Tighnari explains that Collei is afflicted by Eleazar, a disease endemic to Sumeru that causes dark and hardened scales to form on the body; eventually, the person becomes completely immobile. Collei's mother, learning that the Fatui had a cure, sent her to them, much to Paimon's shock. Tighnari then explains that Collei was treated by a Harbinger known as "The Doctor", who stabilized the disease, but her memories with the Fatui left her deeply scarred and deathly afraid of anyone touching her. Tighnari also apologizes on Collei's behalf.</p>
            <p>After hearing her story, Tighnari sets off to find the herbs required to create Collei's medicine. The Traveler and Paimon decide to accompany him and he accepts under the condition that they follow his instructions. They acquire four Lunar Lotuses, much to Tighnari's delight as he was able to stock up on other supplies in the process. Suddenly, Amir and Nasrin arrive, informing Tighnari that a Withering Zone appeared on their patrol route; they could not get measurements as no one had a Vision.</p>
            <p>Arriving outside the zone, Tighnari explains how to handle the phenomenon. After identifying and handling the branches, they destroy the tumor and restore the area back to normal. Tighnari expresses gratitude that they dealt with the zone quickly, but states that the amount of zones appearing have increased, damaging the ecosystem and also causing Collei's symptoms to worsen, a trait shared by others at the Akademiya. Returning to the village, Tighnari notices Haypasia's Dusk Bird and realizes something is wrong — the scholar had forgotten food and thus needs some. After realizing that the Traveler could manipulate Dendro, Tighnari does not apologize for his deception, but states that what they saw affected all of Teyvat — they had connected to the consciousness of Irminsul.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Silent Seeker of Knowledge</h4>
            <p>Returning to Haypasia, the Traveler finds a strange fungi that flees upon seeing them. When Paimon returns, the two find themselves in a strange area but are able to navigate their way through. At the top of the area, they run into the Abyss Herald but are unable to harm it. The Herald proclaims that their sibling had forsaken them and attacks, but the Traveler then returns to the real world; however, they are unable to recall what just happened. Paimon then returns and they find Haypasia lying beside some fruits. As she comes to, they give her Tighnari's letter. She also discovers they saw the strange fungi creature, stating that she had also seen them too while meditating. After serving her the boxed lunch, the Traveler talks about Irminsul with her.</p>
            <p>Returning back to the village, they find Tighnari arguing with some Akademiya members, with Sage Khajeh trying to convince him to join the Akademiya. However, he refuses on the account of his responsibilities and that Khajeh had no definite answer as to how long he would be staying in the city. The Traveler and Paimon then ask Tighnari to help them meet Lesser Lord Kusanali through an acquaintance he knew in the city. After seeing Collei off, they head to Sumeru City.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Trail of the God of Wisdom</h4>
            <p>Upon arriving at the city, the two are given an Akasha Terminal and they head straight to Rohawi, Tighnari's acquaintance. However, they fail to get the answers they sought. The Traveler then remembers and visits Katheryne, who is likewise unable to procure the information but suggests they go to Asfand; The Eremites might have information on her as they work all across Sumeru. Asfand however states that the Eremites have even less information as they are not religious and have less need for it. He also tells them that the Akademiya only upholds Rukkhadevata more than Kusanali, since the former is seen as the one who made Sumeru. As the Traveler and Paimon walk around lamenting, a woman named Dunyarzad overhears them and tells them of a legend about the Archon; however, she spots two Eremites and flees. The two Eremites then ask Traveler and Paimon if they saw Dunyarzad. Wanting to find more information, Paimon misdirects them before catching up to her.</p>
            <p>With more Eremites arriving, the trio run into the nearby tavern. While inside, Dehya rushes at the Traveler, but is ordered by Dunyarzad to stand down. Dehya is her bodyguard and the Eremites were hired to help track her down, but Dunyarzard refuses to go along. Dehya decides not to take her in as she respects her determination, but suggests that she try to make her departures less conspicuous as the latest excursion caused her father to send all the guards at the estate looking for her. They then have a meal, where Dunyarzard explains why she's a follower of Kusanali — she met Kusanali while having a fever, and thus believes the Archon saved her. As such, she had gone out to help organize the Sabzeruz Festival and also met Nilou.</p>
            <p>The four head to the Grand Bazaar to meet up with Nilou who explains about the festival's origins. While the Traveler and Paimon are looking around, they also see Katheryne on break before she leaves back to the Guild. Dehya tells the Traveler that she and Dunyarzad have a plan to get them to meet Kusanali, although she has to speak with someone first and even then, the visit might not be guaranteed. They return to Asfand, who mentions a theft. He explains that a convoy from the Akademiya went to Aaru Village to pick up some items but were robbed on the way back, with the items being connected to the Dendro Archon. Asfand warns them to be careful of the Eremites at the port, as they aren't as friendly as those in the city and some have been proclaiming about the return of the Scarlet King, who he believes to have died a long time ago. Asfand also tells them to act as Akademiya students, but does not disclose the reason.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Lost in Prosperity</h4>
            <p>Arriving at Port Ormos, the Traveler overhears several Akademiya students lamenting about being unable to pay the Eremites at the tavern, so they go there. Two Eremites of the the interest group, Ayn Al-Ahmar, boast about the Scarlet King's return. The Traveler approaches them and offers them 500,000 Mora for information, but before they leave, Alhaitham stops them as the two are being conned. Alhaitham threatens to harm the Eremites' reputation if they continue their acts, so they instead agree to have a fight to settle the matter and leave, returning the Mora to the Traveler.</p>
            <p>The two follow Alhaitham who states that he was simply using them as a means to get close to the fringe group. The Traveler offers to help him in the upcoming battle, which he initially refuses, but accepts when they tell him they can manipulate elemental energy. Alhaitham is amused that the two didn't even know what they were looking for, but gives them the address of a merchant to try their luck and reveals the item that everyone was looking for; a Knowledge Capsule, a mini Akasha which anyone could access if they connected it to their terminal. However, possession or selling of such capsules are prohibited and thus any the Eremites get their hands on are either used for themselves or sold to the common people or students for profit. The Traveler, insistent on finding the lost capsule, decides to negotiate with Alhaitham, who takes them to a more secluded area first.</p>
            <p>There, Alhaitham tells them that he's looking for Dori, a merchant who dabbles in high-quality goods for further collaboration, as her wares are against Akademiya regulations. Believing himself to be on her blacklist, he tells them to gain her trust and avoid any tricks she might have on her sleeve. He offers them a large amount of Mora and her informant's address and password, telling them to use as much Mora as they can to get her trust. After a brief run-down on identifying potentially useful Canned Knowledge, he warns them to be wary of the Matra, as many have been present in the port lately; they serve as the Akademiya's regulatory body.</p>
            <p>The two head to Dori's informants and reach the warehouse, where they gain their trust before they spot the matra and run. They reach the merchant, Dori, who states that the matra sighting was just a bluff as she wants customers who could run so they wouldn't get in trouble if they actually arrived. Dori, learning why they came, showcases some Canned Knowledge; the Traveler uses Elemental Sight to pick the best three. Paimon takes Dori's extra offer, so they decide to take the knowledge regarding swordfighting.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Ever So Close</h4>
            <p>With Dori's trust gained, the two head to the Wikala Funduq to meet up with Alhaitham, where they give him the canned knowledge. Asking why they're intent with the lost capsule, he learns that they wish to meet the Dendro Archon. He reveals that the capsule lost by the Akademiya is apparently one containing divine knowledge and that it is in the port. He had made an agreement with several Eremite brigades, wishing to forgo ownership in return for studying it; however, brigades like Ayn Al-Ahmar were unwilling to negotiate. With the Traveler's aid, he had made significant gains and asks them to meet up with Dori to buy information on the divine capsule. After informing him they bought one, Paimon asks him how to use it, so they head to the outskirts of port to test it.</p>
            <p>Using the Canned Knowledge, Alhaitham evaluates the Traveler's combat capabilities and notes that they had a slight combat improvement, as they were so strong that it barely changed anything. After waiting two days, they return to Dori for information, who reveals that the leader of Ayn Al-Ahmar, Mizri, acquired the capsule. They then head to the docks to meet with the brigade and fight them, with Mizri soon appearing, having taken the knowledge. However, he appears to be in a dazed trance and nearly beats up Tariq, forcing Alhaitham to cut his connection to the Akasha Terminal. As the matra arrive to take Mizri away, Alhaitham secretly pilfers the capsule from Mizri, who mutters "World... forget me", the same words the Traveler heard from Irminsul when they arrived in Sumeru. Alhaitham returns to the Akademiya while Paimon remembers the Sabzeruz Festival and advises the Traveler to rest and relax for the time being.</p>

            <h3 id="ch3act2" align="center">Act II: The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings</h3><!--Chapter III Act II-->
            <hr>
            <h4 align="center">The Coming of the Sabzeruz Festival</h4>
            <p>Returning to the Grand Bazaar, Paimon greets Dunyarzad, who asks them how their trip to Port Ormos went. The Traveler tells them that they did not get any useful information about Lesser Lord Kusanali and remarks on joining them in the future, causing Dehya to appear and scold her for the thought. Dunyarzad asks Dehya to relax for the day, who agrees since she'll be on the lookout for suspicious people during the festival.</p>
            <p>Paimon yawns, so Dunyarzad provides them with some accommodation for the night. The following day, they catch up to her, where she expresses excitement over the Sabzeruz Festival, having been unable to sleep enough for the day. They walk around the stalls to support the merchants, who had come to support the festival out of the blue and without regard to profit. After visiting a candy stall, Dunyarzad decides to return to the lodging as she forgot something, but they soon run into an Eremite brigade intent on capturing her. However, Dehya arrives and insists on taking the group alone, so the two flee to safety.</p>
            <p>After getting some distance, Dehya returns, having routed the enemy brigade but Dunyarzad notices that she's injured, which Dehya mentions was as a result of not getting used to her new greatsword. Dunyarzad then realizes that the anonymous donation was actually from Dehya. After Dunyarzard begins to show signs of fatigue, Dehya orders the Traveler to bring her somewhere safe while she patrols the area to ensure no one else was following them.</p>
            <p>At another area, Dunyarzad reveals to the Traveler and Paimon that she is afflicted with Eleazar and has lived with it for so long that her death seems inevitable; as such, she was doing everything to make an impact and be remembered for something. She then remembers the dance and the three race to the bazaar, only to find Nilou being scolded by Azar and Setaria. Dunyarzad is surprised to see Azar in-person and attempts to intervene, but the Traveler stops her as the Akademiya has too much power. Azar demands that the stage be dismantled before expressing an intent to decree the prohibiting of public art performances through the Akasha. With no choice, the festival ends early, although Nilou promises to make a better festival the following year. As Paimon laments how the festival ended early, a beeping sound is heard with an unknown voice stating that the project has just begun.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Arrival of the Sabzeruz Festival</h4>
            <p>The festival repeats again, however, the Traveler feels as if something is off. At the candy stall, the Traveler takes their leave and heads to Lambad Tavern and orders some Coconut Charcoal Cakes and eats them, recalling the taste. Paimon realizes that something is off too and they attempt to try something else, only to notice Dunyarzad sitting at the bench. They then witness Azar and Setaria scolding Nilou; with nothing discovered, they sleep again and the same beep starts again. This time, the voice notices a variation in the data and orders someone or something to monitor what's causing it.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Continuation of the Sabzeruz Festival</h4>
            <p>As the festival loops again, the Traveler guesses all the candies in the boxes before spotting a strange girl and chases after her. After stopping at the Bimarstan hospital, the girl shows a Canned Knowledge and has both the Traveler and Paimon use it, causing them to realize that they've been stuck in a one-day samsara for several days now. The Dunyarzad that appeared on the cot is the actual one and is deathly ill. The girl introduces herself as Nahida and states that she's trying her best to save her, but they don't have a lot of time and tells them to find as much information as possible before the day ends.</p>
            <p>The two try to ask the same people if they felt anything strange, but then decide to go to Dehya. After revealing that they knew about the kidnappers and Dehya selling her greatsword, they take her to Nahida. However, she fails to see Nahida, who tells the two that only they can see her. However, Dehya suddenly senses Dunyarzad's aura, feeling her regret and disappointment, so the Traveler begins to explain what was happening. Dehya agrees with their logic, believing that the sages were probably responsible for the samsara. Nahida then tells them that the Akasha uses the Gnosis to operate and that it gathers and compiles knowledge to the people; upon mentioning this, Dehya is confused as to what compiling meant.</p>
            <p>The Traveler concludes that the Akasha is causing mental fatigue, in which Dehya notes that her head feels heavier than usual and wonders if the Akasha is harvesting information from them. Everyone takes their terminals off, but the beeping sound is heard again and the next day begins. The Traveler and Paimon remember everything this time and are met by Nahida. After running the entire day again, the Traveler and Paimon notice that Dehya wasn't injured fighting the kidnappers. When asking her if something felt off, she felt as if she knew how to use her greatsword despite not remembering it, making the two hopeful that something might have changed.</p>
            <p>Returning to Nahida, she tells them to wait the next day.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Causality of the Sabzeruz Festival</h4>
            <p>The following day, they return to Dehya, who finds their theory of having their memories erased absurd. As proof of her own evidence, she shows them a training dummy, stating that the sages would have no way to reproduce her swordsmanship for each loop. They then realize that they haven't left the city and decide to do so, reporting back to Nahida, who told them that they already did it twice, so they wait the next day.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Empty Illusions of the Sabzeruz Festival</h4>
            <p>Carrying out the plan, Paimon tells them what happened in the two days they left; they seemingly never returned and the Traveler reported that they couldn't go back and that the festival was one of many spaces. Realizing they need more information, they ask Nahida to create a device, who does so and such records the messages. The Traveler then realizes the truth of the Akasha and the sages are actually stealing dreams from the people of Sumeru. They also realize that Nahida is actually Lesser Lord Kusanali, the Dendro Archon they're looking for. After finishing up questions regarding the dreamscape, the beep rings and they wait the next day.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The End of the Sabzeruz Festival</h4>
            <p>The next day, Nahida disappointingly informs them that Dunyarzad's consciousness disappeared, as it could no longer handle the Akasha harvesting. The Traveler and Paimon are also saddened by her apparent demise, but Nahida tells them how to break the samsara; by making the host of the samsara realize they're dreaming. They first decide to go to Vihar, but discover that he isn't the host. After hearing Dehya yelling in the distance, the Traveler goes to her to help against the Eremites, even though Dehya handled them herself in the previous cycles.</p>
            <p>Ordering Dehya to leave, the Traveler takes their anger over Dunyarzad's fate on the Eremites before deciding to investigate what Dunyarzad had forgotten. However, feeling it would be rude to just enter without permission, Paimon notices an open window and flies inside, returning with a diary containing her thoughts on the two. Running off to the puppet Dunyarzad, they thank it before sitting down on the nearby bench. They then decide to watch the Dance of Sabzeruz and find Azar and Setaria scolding Nilou. However, the Traveler bumps in, causing them to freeze, confirming their suspicions that they were actually puppets.</p>
            <p>Nilou is surprised by the Traveler's intervention before realizing the flowers at the back are actual Padisarahs, causing them to realize that Nilou is actually the host of the dream, since genuine Padisarahs have been long extinct. As Paimon wonders how to break her out of the dream, Nilou realizes that she's dreaming and explains about the tale of the First Sage. Now realizing she's in a dream, Nilou decides to perform the dance as the dreamscape dissolves, during which the two also see Dunyarzad's spirit. Waking up, they run back to where they met Nahida, finding Dunyarzad back in-person and Katheryne next to her.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Dawn</h4>
            <p>Talking to "Katheryne", they realize that it is just Nahida possessing her. She suggests speaking elsewhere and they stop by the same bench, where Nahida reveals she left the city in the last cycle and found a fragment of Dunyarzhad's consciousness, which she was barely able to sustain until the samsara broke. However, she is significantly tired from doing so, but tells the two that the Akasha would be unable to host an event of such size for some time. She plans to investigate what caused the sages to step out of line before leaving to rest. As she leaves, Katheryne comes back to her own senses and asks the two what happened. </p>

            <p>Paimon suddenly thinks about Katheryne and thus asks the Traveler to check up on her. When they arrive, she gives them strange commissions, causing them to realize that they're actually talking to Nahida instead. Nahida has a plan to try to figure out what the sages are learning but suggests speaking elsewhere. Paimon asks about Dunyarzad's health, to which Nahida states that she's recovering, but to fully remove Eleazar, they need to fix Irminsul's withering.</p>
            <p>At the arranged spot, Nahida asks the Traveler for their suggestions, all of which she declines due to the immense risks. She instead reveals that they should find someone who has ties with them but hasn't fully dedicated their cause. The Traveler initially believes this to be Alhaitham, but Nahida had already decided on Setaria, Azar's subordinate. She explains that Setaria actually hails from the desert, but is plagued by her guilt over the sages' questionable work and inability to help the desert people. As such, she believes that if they can make Setaria confront her guilt, they'll have a mole on the inside.</p>
            <p>Nahida takes them to the marketplace where they talk with Nabiya, Akim and Qishan, where the Traveler learns how they speak and how to act. The following day, as Setaria prepares her to shop, Nahida tells the Traveler that because she still has trouble with human behavior, they'll be the ones to do the job. Using her powers, the Traveler remotely possesses them and passes off the impression that they're believers of the Scarlet King. During her conversation with Nabiya, they learn that the Scarlet King's resurrection is actually a misinformation campaign by the Akademiya. After talking to the three, Setaria panics and flags down Rima to warn the matra of the heretics, but Rima becomes possessed and forces Setaria to admit her guilt and promise to help. Setaria also reveals that an expelled outcast returned to the city, causing the sages to be wary.</p>
            <p>Worried that the Akademiya might be keeping tabs on her, Setaria advises to pick the documents up at the entrance the following night. When the time comes, the Traveler and Nahida note that there's far less people out on the streets, causing them some worry. Nonetheless, they head to the Akademiya entrance, where they find many people in a trance. Suddenly, a man appears and introduces himself as Il Dottore, the second of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. Dottore reveals that he manipulated the peoples' Akasha Terminals to believe that the Traveler is a hero, causing them to approach them. However, Nahida uses her powers to put them all to sleep and urges them to run.</p>
            <p>After gaining enough distance, Paimon is shocked to discover a high-ranking Harbinger in Sumeru and that the Fatui were also involved in the sages' plot. With no other leads to go on, the Traveler decides to visit Tighnari.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Gaze from a Certain God</h4>
            <p>Making their way to Gandharva Ville, the Traveler and Paimon are ambushed by an Eremite group led by Tashfin, although they manage to repel the mercenaries. Arriving into the ville, they find Collei, who's glad to see them. She remarks that her Eleazar condition has gotten worse recently and as such, Tighnari ordered her to stay at the ville. She also reveals that he went to Pardis Dhyai for reasons unknown.</p>
            <p>Arriving at Pardis Dhyai, the pair run into Nahida, who had escaped Dottore's grasp by mind-jumping at the last second. However, she believes he might trap her in the Akasha system, forcing them to double their efforts. The Traveler explains that they're looking for Tighnari and she assists them in the search. When they arrive at the greenhouse, they run into Haypasia, who believes that she had reached Paripurna Life and offers to show them what she saw, which the Traveler accepts.</p>
            <p>The vision that Haypasia saw was actually that of Scaramouche's memory, much to the Traveler and Paimon's shock as they realize that she went mad, only for her to realize the same too as she walks off. Nahida then senses that something's wrong and they run out, only to find Corps of Thirty members arriving to attack. While the Traveler tries their best to repel the assassins, Nahida is stabbed in the chest by a spear, although the two manage to connect a finger.</p>
            <p>The Traveler suddenly finds themselves in Nahida's own body at the Sanctuary of Surasthana, where they witness Scaramouche in the process of being made a god. When they come to back in their own body, they find themselves fleeing Pardis Dhyai with Tighnari escorting them, where Paimon reveals that he heard the commotion and helped them defeat the assassins. While the Traveler's consciousness was displaced into Nahida's body, Nahida had been swapped into theirs to help them escape — unfortunately, Nahida was captured by the Doctor upon swapping back, leaving her trapped in the Sanctuary with no means of controlling bodies remotely anymore.</p>
            <p>Tighnari advises the Traveler to not give up, relaying the last message Nahida could leave behind: "Even in a moonless night, a shower of starlight can still drown out illusions and lies." Recognizing that she once used "Starlight" to refer to The Eremites like Setaria, the Traveler realizes that Nahida must want them to seek help from the desert folk of the Great Red Sand. The Traveler then tells the two what they saw from Nahida's vision; with two Harbingers in Sumeru, trouble is bound to happen. Tighnari also reveals that he went to Pardis Dhyai to monitor Haypasia's condition, as it was unusual compared to other scholars and that the matra would have dragged her to Aaru Village otherwise. He suggests they head to Caravan Ribat to reach the desert while he stays behind to help Haypasia.</p>
            <h4 align="center">The Four at Loggerheads</h4>
            <p>Arriving at Caravan Ribat, the Traveler and Paimon remark about the Wall of Samiel when Alhaitham appears and tells them to follow him, narrowly escaping a group of Eremites who were hunting them down. Alhaitham tells them that he's still studying the capsule and believes the Traveler might be hiding something from him before offering to go to Aaru Village with them, which they accept.</p>
            <p>When they arrive at the village, the Traveler senses someone waiting to attack and parries the first strike before they clash with Alhaitham to a standstill. Alhaitham recognizes the man as Cyno, the General Mahamatra. Cyno demands he reveal the Divine Knowledge Capsule before Alhaitham questions him being alone in the desert, as the other matra were wondering where he went. Suddenly, Dehya arrives and tries to mediate, although the two men are still insistent on fighting. A sandstorm then kicks up, forcing the group into the village chief's hut when another woman calls out to them.</p>
            <p>Inside, the woman introduces herself as Candace and warns them not to cause a fight in the village again before asking them to explain what happened. Cyno goes first, stating that he put himself in exile after noticing missing data that Azar submitted himself. When he tried to investigate, Azar denied his request, stating that he had no right to judge them. Cyno then reveals that Alhaitham had been tasked with tracking the Traveler, who doesn't deny the accusation, but reveals that he did not accept it, as the sages had promised him divine knowledge, which he found extremely suspicious. Dehya then explains that she was just bored and wanted to return to the village, just as they hear growling outside. Candace leaves the house to handle the monsters.</p>
            <p>After some time passes, the Traveler and Dehya worry about her condition, so they head out and find her fighting some riftwolves and join in, repelling the enemy attack. The village chief, Uncle Anpu, then arrives, explaining that the Village Keepers have gone missing recently with no trace. Cyno explains that they're actually the exiled scholars of the Akademiya, as they believe that their crazed ramblings would give a negative psyche to others. Cyno then asks the Traveler to meet him elsewhere for a conversation.</p>
            <p>At the arranged spot, Cyno explains the history of the Village Keepers; they were initially shunned by the village due to not being useful, but when an earthquake struck one day a mad scholar crouched to the ground with a green light radiating from him, protecting the entire village from any damage. The Traveler believes this to be the Dendro Archon's work, which Cyno believes and is surprised to learn that the Archon walks among the people. Just then, a boy named Isak appears and asks them to help find his grandpa.</p>
            <p>Returning to the chief's house, Cyno confirms with Candace about Isak, who explains his past to them. Isak is delighted to learn that they'll be searching for his grandpa, so they begin to look for leads. </p>

            <h3 id="ch3act4" align="center">Act IV: King Deshret and the Three Magi</h3><!--Chapter III Act IV-->
            <hr>
            <h4 align="center">The Missing Village Keepers</h4>
            <p>The Traveler and Cyno begin their investigation on the missing Village Keepers by talking to some of the locals. After talking to them, Cyno overhears two others talking about the Scarlet King's resurrection and confronts them. The two people, Sharkan and Makan, are terrified of Cyno's presence and quickly spill everything they know, including their hatred for the Dendro Archon and that a "radical" was responsible for the missing cases. Cyno warns them not to warn the radicals before Isak brings them to his grandpa's house, where the Traveler nearly faints from the aftermath of some incense.</p>
            <p>Cyno then catches a whiff of the incense after concentrating and upon hearing Paimon mention Tighnari, tells them that he's a friend of his. After some further investigation around the hut, he discovers that someone else had come in and lured Isak's grandpa away with the incense. Returning to the village chief's house, Dehya suggests visiting her drinking friends at Caravan Ribat, but stops Cyno from coming along as she's worried he might intimidate them. Cyno and Candace remain behind while the Traveler accompanies Dehya.</p>
            <p>As the two travel back to Caravan Ribat, Dehya expresses her hatred for the Wall of Samiel, explaining that its purpose of protecting the rainforest from sandstorms has been co-opted by the sages to also keep the Eremites out of Sumeru, as the sages simply take advantage of them, regarding the desertfolk as little more than tools or livestock to be exploited and discarded, "undeserving" of the Akasha's wisdom. At the local tavern, Dehya meets with Zaki and tells him to let Delavar that she has a spice deal for him. When Zaki takes them to the arranged spot, it is revealed to be an ambush, with both Delavar and Engur also appearing. Believing Dehya to be an incompetent fighter, they are quickly surprised when she and the Traveler defeats them with ease before taking them back to Aaru Village.</p>
            <p>The following night, Candace interrogates the radicals for information and they reveal that the Eremite band had met with a masked man claiming to be the Scarlet King's envoy, who gave them incense to lure the Village Keepers out. They would then meet at a junction where the man would take them away to an unknown location. Uncle Anpu then chimes in, but to ensure the radicals wouldn't learn anything, Cyno knocks them out. Uncle Anpu states that he believes the mystery man might be related to the Akademiya, as they approached him before to take the Village Keepers back, which he refused.</p>
            <p>The group prepares to set out for the desert to find more information, while Candace stays behind to handle the radicals.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Cry from the Eleazar Hospital</h4>
            <p>Before the group leaves, Paimon spots Alhaitham, believing he had done nothing useful. Alhaitham tells them he had stayed in the village to continue his investigation and reveals that one of the villagers they spoke to had not been completely truthful to them. He explains that if the person had become too friendly to the Village Keepers, they could make themselves a target for the radicals. The group quickly realizes that Shani had lied and return to her home to demand an explanation. Shani explains that she could hear screaming in the night, which Alhaitham confirmed with one of the village guards. After asking what was around the village, Shani tells them that there was an abandoned Eleazar hospital nearby and they go there to investigate.</p>
            <p>Arriving at Dar al-Shifa, the Traveler eliminates the monsters camping outside. After Alhaitham unlocks the entrance, they wait for nightfall, upon which they hear the crying that Shani had heard. Alhaitham discovers a hidden entrance and after unlocking a few more mechanisms, they enter the hospital and discover a person inside, who Alhaitham recognizes as Razak. Alhaitham realizes that they might be too late, since there were traces that indicated a hasty withdrawal. He explains that the Akademiya's misinformation campaign made the radicals spring into action to unknowingly help in their plans while ensuring that no liability could be traced to them, reminding them of their encounter with Mizri at Port Ormos as an example.</p>
            <p>They take Razak back to the village, where they brief the others on what they found at the hospital. Cyno wonders how the Akademiya is aware of their plans before Alhaitham tells him that he's the mole, much to his anger. He explains that the sages knew of his conviction and that it posed a threat to them, so they needed to monitor him at all times. While he was idling about, Alhaitham found a book detailing his activities and movements which were uploaded to the Akasha on Jnagarbha Day. Cyno fails to see the reasoning behind it until Alhaitham tells him that the Akasha is capable of computation, thus it could predict his activities for the day. Cyno is initially dismayed at this, but realizes that if they were trying to avoid him, the perpetrators would go in the direction opposite of him; the desert.</p>
            <p>Heading out into the desert, they find some headsets buried in the sand and continue following them, surmising that they were left there recently. Cyno then hears arguing and they spot Dehya and a group of Eremites led by Rahman. Isak, believing Dehya to have betrayed them, confronts her, causing the others to follow up, much to Dehya's annoyance as she was trying to convince Rahman to aid them. Rahman refuses to accept Dehya's reasoning, so Alhaitham offers himself as a hostage, although he still refuses to accept the deal. Dehya asks Alhaitham if he'd uphold his promises, which he does. Dehya then asks Rahman if he trusts her, which he does. She then offers her right arm as payment for her friends' words, which Rahman accepts and orders one of his men to chop her arm off.</p>
            <p>At the last moment, Rahman changes his mind, believing that cutting her arm off would be akin to cutting his own fingers and sees no point in hurting his own kin. He allows the group to leave, but demands a fight the next day to settle the score, which she accepts.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Secret of the Scorching Desert</h4>
            <p>The next day, the group heads out to meet up with Rahman's group. However, they only find one of the Village Keepers, which Rahman states that it was a one-on-one exchange since he had reluctantly accepted the honesty of Dehya's friends. This angers her, who immediately charges and easily overwhelms him. One of Rahman's men then threatens Isak's grandpa, but when his hands start shaking, another scolds him for cowardice. The man then loosens his grip before realizing that it's an earthquake, but Isak's grandpa suddenly glows and protects the entire group with a barrier as the sands swallow them.</p>
            <p>When the group comes to, they find themselves in some mysterious ruins which excites Rahman as the ruins belong to the Scarlet King. Rahman leaves his group to let them recover as he joins the others in investigating, where they find the Dendro Archon's power imbued in the ruins, which gets the group's attention due to the harmony between the Dendro Archon and the Scarlet King. After running into some runes, Alhaitham deciphers them, revealing the transcript to be from Kasala, the last priest of the Scarlet King. The transcript tells how the Scarlet King introduced forbidden knowledge to his people, causing them to go mad; to save them, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata used her own powers to give the people life. This was not without a cost, as the Scarlet King chose to sacrifice himself to prevent the knowledge from returning, while Rukkhadevata reverted to a small child.</p>
            <p>Rahman is shocked by the transcript before realizing that he and his people made an enemy of their savior and accepts the truth. He apologizes to the group for his actions and promises to return the Village Keepers and share what supplies his people have after explaining to them what he saw. Upon arriving at his stronghold, Rahman brings the group to the perpetrators, Morghi and Judar. Upon seeing both Alhaitham and Cyno, they become terrified. The Traveler asks them if the sages were planning to create a new god, which they confirm, much to the group's surprise. They explain that since Rukkhadevata's death, scientific breakthroughs had been rare and on the decline. After Il Dottore approached them with the notion to create a new god, they accepted and began to set the plan in motion, with the dream samsara and harvesting Divine Canned Knowledge from the mad scholars being part of the process to create their new god.</p>
            <p>Returning to the village with the Village Keepers and the suspects, everyone agrees that what the sages are doing is completely unacceptable and begin to concoct a plan to crush the sages and rescue their true god. </p>

            <h3 id="ch3act5" align="center">Act V: Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises</h3><!--Chapter III Act V-->
            <hr>
            <h4 align="center">Through the Predawn Night</h4>
            <p>As the day starts, the Traveler and Paimon find Candace, who tells them that everyone is waiting. She asks has them promise that they wouldn't get too reckless before entering the village chief's home, where they catch up with Alhaitham, Cyno and Dehya. They formulate a plan before going off to finish up some last minute preparations. Alhaitham's plan involves taking action on the next Jnagarbha Day. Candace could tell that the meeting went along well and while she would remain behind to protect the village, she prays for their success.</p>
            <p>Catching up to Alhaitham, he had just finished speaking with Rahman. Alhaitham reminds them that they need to commit to the plan due to the serious circumstances involved. He then states that as a scholar, he could advise the mercenaries from behind rather than having to fight at the front. He also points out that he had not known of forbidden knowledge while working at the Akademiya and suspects that the scholars and mercenaries who used it fell victim to its corruption; however, the Akademiya treated it as something else, and he suspects that what is happening now happened in the past. Paimon tells him that Tighnari had told them that Irminsul was connected to Sumeru's ailments and that they should inform Nahida, although Alhaitham fails to see the reason why until the Traveler explains it to him. This makes him conclude that saving Lesser Lord Kusanali much more important, but before they could start, he needs finish his preparations and they head off to Rahman's base.</p>
            <p>Arriving at Rahman's base, they find Morghi and Judar working, as Alhaitham had given them something to do. Paimon spots the headset from before alongside some Canned Knowledge capsules, causing her to become nervous. Alhaitham explains that they wouldn't be using them yet, but asks the Traveler to remind themselves of their conviction. As they wear the headset, Alhaitham asks them to simulate the successful rescue of Kusanali and that Sumeru's political landscape has changed. Paimon is still unsure as to his intentions before he explains that people have relied too much on the Akasha and thus they're slaves to orders. With his preparation done, he sends them off to Cyno at Caravan Ribat while he finishes up some other small tasks with the Akademiya scholars.</p>
            <p>Making their way to Cyno, the Traveler finds him arguing with Rahman over the plan, as Cyno could not accept a plan with immense casualties. Rahman states that they don't have a choice and that it's their best option, but Cyno is still unconvinced, as he had gone to Alhaitham for advice. Rahman admits that he knows the ways of the desert before he explains the plan; using his capacities as a Matra, Cyno would work with the guards at the outpost to arrest Rahman's men, as they were unregistered and that the outpost would never accept so much Eremites at once, being their best bet to infiltrate Sumeru City. Cyno states that Alhaitham gave him that suggestion and while he would ensure his men would not be hurt, the other guards wouldn't be as considerate and he is against meaningless loss. The Traveler offers to help, which both accept. Cyno, seeing Rahman's determination, decides to go with the plan.</p>
            <p>Heading to the outpost, Cyno informs the guards that he's about to make a large arrest and needs their assistance in apprehending them. The guards go off to inform their superiors; as they do so, Paimon is worried that they might have been feigning support. However, Cyno reminds them of their discussion, in which Alhaitham believed that the guards at Caravan Ribat should be unaware that Cyno had stepped down due to his fellow Matra not knowing his current status and that if something happened to him, it would attract unwanted attention and potentially expose their master plan. Alhaitham also reminds the group of the Akasha's computation capabilities, although confident that it would be unable to discover their plan yet as they were all working together. Paimon is relieved before Cyno reminds her to pay attention next time as they hear footsteps.</p>
            <p>The guards returned with their superior, Luxembarbo, who Cyno briefs on his mission and introduces the Traveler and Paimon as his assistant and their construct respectively. Cyno requests an elite platoon to set out in two days to apprehend Rahman's men. After two days pass, they meet up with Cyno at the outskirts of the village, where they find Luxembarbo and his men there already. Cyno reminds them that they need Rahman's men alive before they conveniently arrive on scene. After a brief struggle, Rahman and his men are arrested and taken away.</p>
            <p>With no one to hear them, Cyno promises to get Rahman and his men into Sumeru City before asking them to proceed with the next part of the plan; assisting Dehya in convincing Tighnari to support them. While Paimon is concerned that he would not help due to not telling him the full plan, Cyno is confident that his relationship with Tighnari would get the message through.</p>
            <h4 align="center">As by a God's Side</h4>
            <p>Returning to Caravan Ribat, Dehya jokingly scolds them for being late. Due to the threat posed by Il Dottore, Dehya states that they'll need information on him before proceeding with their plan. The current plan involves heading to Pardis Dhyai to find Tighnari, who Alhaitham and Cyno believe still have the Akademiya's trust, and thus use him to get as much information as possible to adjust their plan if needed.</p>
            <p>Arriving at Pardis Dhyai, they find Tighnari and ask to speak with him privately. Learning that Cyno was working with them, he agrees to help out in any way possible while not asking for the finer details. When they ask him about Dottore, he tells them that the Harbinger had just left, having arrived to ask him to give Haypasia to him for reasons unknown outside of working on her treatment. Tighnari refused, as he sensed an aura similar to that of other scholars. Dottore admitted that he would have dealt with him, but with the Tsaritsa calling for his return, he had no time but remarked that he could finish up some loose ends before leaving.</p>
            <p>Asking where he went, Tighnari points them in the direction he left in. Although Paimon is unsure as to how they could track him, Dehya uses her mercenary skills and determines he's leaving via Port Ormos. There, they find a large Fatui entourage before they hide in Wikala Funduq. However, Dottore spots and waves at them, causing them to realize that he had misled them and that they're going after Haypasia instead. Rushing back to Pardis Dhyai, they help Tighnari drive the Fatui off before checking on Haypasia. However, touching her caused a manifestation of Scaramouche to appear, who tells them that their mission is futile as neither they nor Nahida could defeat him.</p>
            <p>The Traveler asks why he's talking to them, in which he replies that he's just in a good mood. They ask some questions, stating that the Akademiya only sees him as a new Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and that the process to ascend him is risky. While Scaramouche notes their genuine concern, he states that he was always meant to be a god. He expresses his disgust for humanity, but when the Traveler points out that he could have cut his connection to Haypasia, he admits that he does have some affection for her, in that he saw her worthy to be his first follower due to seeing his past. The Traveler informs him of Dottore's intentions, but he believes it as an attempt to sow discord and showcases his newfound power by causing lightning around Pardis Dhyai.</p>
            <p>Worried about Dehya and Tighnari, they head out and find that Tighnari had been struck by lightning. Dehya states that the weather took a change and tore most of the Fatui. Tighnari states that he'll be fine, but notices that the Traveler looks concerned. Heading in the greenhouse, the Traveler informs them of their encounter with Scaramouche. Dehya takes this as their plan being successful, as Dottore had left. She tells them to meet up with the group at the Grand Bazaar at the appointed time.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Jnagarbha Day</h4>
            <p>The next day, the Traveler meets up with Alhaitham outside the Akademiya and asks for a rundown of the plan again. Alhaitham states that they'll be infiltrating Azar's office to access his console, as there should be a way to free Kusanali from the Sanctuary of Surasthana. As Jnagarbha Day is important for the Akademiya, Alhaitham states that they'll just head straight in through the front door, much to Paimon's astonishment. Once they enter, they're met by Viraf, who questions the Traveler's arrival, only for Alhaitham to tell him the reason should be obvious as he walks off.</p>
            <p>Further inside, they head into the House of Daena, where they lay low to ensure they wouldn't run into Azar in the process. However, Azar intercepts them, having been informed by an eyewitness. He takes them to their office, stating that due to Jnagarbha Day, he has little time for small talk and asks why they came before detaining them. The Traveler warns him of the Fatui's motives, but he pays no attention to it, being interested only in their new god. Alhaitham gives him information on the Traveler, leading the two to believe he had betrayed them. However, Azar calls Alhaitham out on his own plan. In an apparent fit of rage, Alhaitham drops the Divine Knowledge Capsule and lunges at Azar, but misses, although he knocks something over before the guards apprehend him. Azar orders him to be exiled to Aaru Village before locking the Traveler and Paimon up, confident that with the Traveler out of the way, the sages' plan would be set for good. As Alhaitham is dragged away, his Akasha reverts to green, revealing that his "insanity" was just a ploy as Nilou watches and smiles.</p>
            <p>In the confinement room, the Traveler and Paimon go over the plan again, as the Traveler had also been tasked to wake Nahida from the Akasha. They manage to find a spot with stable connection and connect to Nahida's consciousness. They initially have trouble connecting to Nahida, as she has self-doubt over her capabilities as an Archon, but after hearing an unknown voice, is convinced to do her best. The Traveler breaks a barrier surrounding her and manages to wake her up. With Nahida's consciousness awoken, the next part of the plan begins.</p>
            <p>Outside, Sheikh Zubayr asks Nilou if she really intends to go with the plan, which she affirms. Zubayr concedes, but warns her to be careful, as the few people of the Bazaar might be unable to help her. Nilou makes her way to the Akademiya, where she performs at the entrance. Azar orders the guards to detain her, but when the order is uploaded to the guards, they're told that Kusanali escaped into the city and are ordered to apprehend her. Alhaitham had planned for this possibility, thus leaving the Akademiya without guards, allowing Dehya and the Eremites to go into action. Dressing Isak as Kusanali, they lure the guards into the Bazaar and defeat them.</p>
            <p>Back at the Akademiya, Azar wonders where the guards are when Uday arrives, having done what he was told. Azar checks the Akasha himself, discovering the order but wonders how it got there in the first place. When Uday questions the Akasha, he unintentionally angers Azar, who goes to the Sanctuary of Surasthana to investigate. When he arrives to confirm the information himself, he runs into Cyno, who demands that he plead guilty to the archon herself. Meanwhile, Dehya frees the Traveler from the confinement room and tells them that the plan was a success.</p>
            <p>Heading into the Sanctuary, the Traveler and Paimon meet Nahida in-person for the first time. Nahida apologizes for putting through situations she caused, but they decline the apology as she wasn't at fault. Now knowing the full extent of the damage, Nahida reverts the Akasha to be used by herself only and revoke all of the sages' access, make them pay for their crimes and also to stop the false god. She advises them to prepare themselves.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies</h4>
            <p>Inside, Nahida remarks on the intricacy of the Akasha before giving the Traveler an "upgraded" version which she made just recently and would help them in their travels. She also reveals that she discovered the false god's location. She also intends to support them, as she doesn't have enough power to fight yet. Needing to connect to Scaramouche's consciousness, they enter the facility, which had been made by the Fatui. As they head deeper into the facility, Nahida could sense that Scaramouche was either nearing or already became a god. When they finally reach him, they find him in a large mechanical suit and that he sees himself as a god, although Nahida notes that the sages weren't able to infuse the Divine Knowledge Capsules into him and that he lacks the spiritual height of one. Nahida awakens him in order to get his attention before he challenges them to a fight as to reenact a scene of the Archon War despite Nahida's pleas otherwise.</p>
            <p>Despite the Traveler's initial attempts, Scaramouche plunges his arm into Nahida's chest to grab her Gnosis, but Nahida reveals that he had been in a repeating samsara. Due to the samsaras, she proceeds to impart the combat knowledge to the Traveler to put them on better fighting terms, alongside compiling the knowledge of Sumeru's people with the Akasha to the "upgraded" terminal, allowing them to defeat Scaramouche. Nahida proceeds to grab the Electro Gnosis from the mechanical chest, causing Scaramouche to fall out as he begs for Nahida not to take it from him.</p>
            <p>Using the Electro Gnosis alongside her own, Nahida and the Traveler enter Rukkhadevata's final memory, although she was surprised to see it severely contaminated. The Traveler explains the concept of forbidden knowledge to her, which she connects to the Scarlet King's time and also the Cataclysm. Nahida clutches in pain as the corroded consciousness is affecting everyone, so set out and find a boat to take them to Rukkhadevata's lucid consciousness to find the answers they seek. When they arrive, the Traveler recalls seeing the same place when they first arrived in Sumeru before they meet a replica of Nahida, although it is Rukkhadevata's consciousness.</p>
            <p>Nahida has many questions for Rukkhadevata, who reveals that she created Nahida from the purest Irminsul branch to serve as her incarnation in the next samsara. Rukkhadevata states that to save Irminsul, Nahida would have to erase her from it, which would remove all traces of her having ever existed on Teyvat. Nahida is upset at this, but regretfully complies. As Rukkhadevata is removed, Irminsul is restored, which in turn allows the people of Sumeru to dream again and removes the forbidden knowledge completely. Returning to the real world, Nahida and Paimon have forgotten about Rukkhadevata, but the Traveler has not; as the Traveler contemplates telling the truth, they suddenly fall asleep.</p>
            <p>Dottore then walks in, having waited too long to speak with Nahida in person and that he simply used a sound wave to put the Traveler and Paimon to sleep. He reveals he came to negotiate, but also reminds her that she can't fight him. Nahida admits this, but threatens to destroy the Electro Gnosis, which in turn could potentially awaken Celestia. Dottore falls for the threat, but Nahida, knowing that Ei's Gnosis would bring disaster to Sumeru, agrees to give it to him as long as he destroys the other segments. Dottore states that he spent many rare resources making them, but agrees and eliminates them all. With the deal made, Dottore inquires about her own Dendro Gnosis, as it has no use now that the Akasha is going to be shut down. Dottore offers her information about the sky and star being a lie, which she accepts for her own Gnosis.</p>
            <p>The Traveler regains consciousness at Gandharva Ville, with Paimon waking them up.</p>
            <h4 align="center">A Toast to Victory</h4>
            <p>Catching up with Collei, the three have breakfast before finding that Nilou had left them a letter. Opening it, they discover that she's invited them to a celebratory feast as Cyno had returned to his original position as General Mahamatra. As they meet up with Tighnari, the Traveler learns that Cyno had brought them to Gandharva Ville to recover, although he was unaware that a feast was being held in his name. The Traveler invites the two along, but they refuse, as the Forest Rangers have been much busier as of late. Tighnari also reveals that Azar and the other sages would be spending the rest of their lives in Avidya Forest to cultivate wisdom after hearing that Nahida had defeated Scaramouche and restored Irminsul.</p>
            <p>Returning to the Grand Bazaar, Nilou tells the Traveler that she had also sent invitations to Alhaitham, Dehya, Dunyarzad, Rahman and Cyno and asks them to look for them to confirm that they got the invitations. Heading into the House of Daena, they find Alhaitham arguing with Kaveh, who had just returned from the desert to discover that the sages had been overthrown. As Kaveh leaves to confirm it with others, Alhaitham notices the Traveler. He remarks on the absurdity of the situation they had just navigated and that he had rejected an offer to become the Grand Sage, as he did not like being a leader. The Traveler informs him of the feast and he agrees to come.</p>
            <p>Heading to Port Ormos, they find Dehya and Dunyarzard, the latter relieved and delighted that all the Eleazar cases were dealt with. Dehya states that she intends to quit serving as her bodyguard, as she wanted to return to her mercenary life. She asks them if Alhaitham told them about considering working for the Akademiya, which they were unaware of. Paimon asks about the invitation, although the two had not been aware of it but thank her and agree to join. Asking where Cyno and Rahman were, Dehya tells them that they were likely at Aaru Village.</p>
            <p>Arriving at Aaru Village, the pair catch up with Cyno just as Rahman and Setaria arrive. Setaria reveals that she intends to leave the Akademiya, but continue her studies so she could enrich the well-being of her people, who had been neglected by the Akademiya. Due to Nahida's manipulation earlier, Setaria resolved to return to the desert and was going to confront Azar when she found that he wasn't there, only for Cyno to inform her that he was gone. Nahida, wanting to put the people of the desert on par with the rainforest, devoted many supplies to help out, but Cyno had to contact Rahman's men to get them distributed. Cyno then learns about the feast in his name and agrees to come, while Rahman and Setaria decline as they're too busy.</p>
            <p>With all the people onboard, the Traveler returns to the Grand Bazaar as the feast goes underway. Noting that the people were now talking about Nahida, they had forgotten about Rukkhadevata but decides to keep her memory a secret to honor her last wish. After talking to a few people, Nahida connects to the Traveler and uses them as a channel to speak with the rest of the group, thanking them for saving her and all of Sumeru. The group is humbled by her presence before she arrives in-person, bringing the feast to its climax.</p>
            <p>The following day, the Traveler returns to the Sanctuary to speak with Nahida, who suggests they go to Fontaine and meet with its Archon, Focalors. She also reveals that while digging through the Akasha, she discovered that their sibling hailed from Teyvat and appeared in Khaenri'ah; after the Cataclysm, they began their travel across Teyvat. However, at the climax of their journey, the records became fuzzy, causing her to suspect that someone was intentionally withholding information their fate. She also reveals that the Fatui had classified them as Teyvat's fourth "Descender," a visitor from outside Teyvat. She suspects the first "Descender" to be the Heavenly Principles, but is unsure as to who the other two were, leaving both with many questions. Nonetheless, she promises to help them on their journey when she has the time. </p>

            <h3 id="ch3act6" align="center">Act VI: Caribert</h3>
            <hr>
            <h4 align="center">Destined Encounter</h4>
            <p>Wandering around Port Ormos, the Traveler and Paimon run into Masrur, who hands them a letter from a "crafty fellow" who used a loophole to get the letter delivered. They read it and find that the letter was from Kaeya, who was stopping at Sumeru and asks to meet up with them at Djafar Tavern in the afternoon. When they arrive, they find that Kaeya had his fill of all the drinks. Paimon wonders as to what he might be doing in Sumeru, believing that as a Captain of the Knights of Favonius, he should be back in Mondstadt and that Jean would be upset. Kaeya states that he had come to scout out Sumeru's alcohol industry, as the tavern itself was home to a special concoction made with spices.</p>
            <p>After the Traveler points out that he's alone, Kaeya admits that he had been to Sumeru before but it brings up bad memories. The Traveler tells him that he doesn't have to go into detail, so Kaeya tells them that in his youth, his adoptive father had been talking to some Sumeran merchants and that his roots lie in Khaenri'ah, which was said to be underneath Sumeru and snuck onto a ship, but he was soon found and brought back. They ask him how much he knows about the nation, and he admits that he only knows a little from reading books, and as he spent less time in Khaenri'ah, he began to care less about it and wondered if his father wanted him to live happily in Mondstadt. As Kaeya remarks that his last name, Alberich, is the last thing tying him to Khaen'riah, Dainsleif inexplicably appears and asks him what he knew about the name.</p>
            <p>The Traveler and Paimon are surprised by Dainsleif's appearance while Kaeya greets him, having sensed him listening in onto their conversation. Dainsleif then states that Kaeya's ancestors, the Alberichs, are the founders of the Abyss Order, leaving everyone surprised. Kaeya expresses surprise at the revelation before recognizing Dainsleif as a pure-blooded inhabitant due to his primogem-shaped eyes. Paimon wonders if Kaeya was working for the Abyss Order, but he does not answer that, saying the conversation steered into too serious a topic. Kaeya then takes his leave, since he had a spice merchant to talk business with.</p>
            <p>As Kaeya leaves, Paimon remarks that the relationship between Kaeya and Dainsleif appears to be tense, comparing it to oil and water. Dainsleif tells her that he doesn't know him well and wonders if Kaeya is being honest about his relationship to the Abyss Order. The Traveler inquires as to the founding of the Order before Paimon asks what he's doing in Sumeru. Dainsleif states that while recovering, he remembered something related to the "Loom of Fate" operation, which the Traveler's Sibling had mentioned when he was traveling with them in Sumeru and thus is trying to find the place they had gone to together in Avidya Forest. Paimon decides to go, but Dainsleif waits for his drink before they do so.</p>
            <p>Arriving at a small farming field, Dainsleif finds the area familiar and they investigate. Paimon worries about rudely intruding, but Dainsleif senses that no one had been around for years. With few leads in the field, they check the hut and find no leads inside either. Dainsleif then hears something outside, where they discover a group of Slimes. After eliminating them, Dainsleif decides to investigate the nearby Ley Lines alone, concerned that something had attracted the monsters. Paimon is worried, but Dainsleif states that the hut is the main investigation and thus the Traveler and Paimon set up a campfire for the night. Paimon asks about the Traveler's sibling, and the Traveler responds that they had frequently looked together at the stars, pointing out planets they wanted to visit, and shares that their stop at Teyvat marked the first time they had been separated. Paimon volunteers to take watch, so the Traveler falls asleep and dreams of their sibling.</p>
            <p>The following morning, the Traveler wakes up to find Dainsleif greeting them. Reminding them of their task, he then notices that they must have dreamed of their sibling due to their tears and lets them be.</p>
            <h4 align="center">Fortune-Mocking Pedigree</h4>
            <p>When the Traveler fully wakes up, they hear noise coming from the house and investigate, only to find an intimidating man scolding them for intruding into his business. They inquire about Paimon, who tells them that she had left for the forest too. When the man tells them to leave, the Traveler refuses, believing he's hiding something and that they have no chance of finding Paimon in the forest. The man admits that he was worried about them being related to the Forest Rangers or Akademiya and allows them to do as they please. When he decides to go inside, the Traveler insists on following, where they find him with a hilichurl with a bandaged wound.</p>
            <p>The man explains that "he" was too young to suffer such a fate before the Traveler realizes the man is from Khaenri'ah. He demands an explanation and the Traveler explains that they knew based on his features. He then asks them if they believe in a god, which they don't. The man then introduces himself as "Eide." He explains that there are few humans who follow no gods and considers those who do to be his enemies. As he rants about the gods and their "gift" that ruined Khaenri'ah, the Traveler asks why some were turned into hilichurls and others were not. Eide explains while only one bloodline founded Khaenri'ah, they welcomed all humans who did not follow the gods. Those considered pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were deemed the "greater sinners" and given the curse of immortality, while the others were given the curse of the wilderness and transformed into hilichurls.</p>
            <p>The Traveler asks about the hilichurl, and the man introduces him as Caribert, his illegitimate son that he had with a woman from Mondstadt while he was unsatisfied with his life as a noble. The Traveler asks him about Caribert's mother, but the man does not disclose anything as he finds it too painful before he remembers what he was going to do and goes out. The Traveler catches up with him and finds him at a crafting bench, where he reveals that he was creating a potion with materials only found in Sumeru to make a temporary cure. Eide asks for some Sumeru Roses and Kalpalata Lotus, with the Traveler assisting and making the medicine. However, it has one more step; to get the blessing of one of the Seven, which Eide finds hard to do but eventually goes with it.</p>
            <p>With the medicine fully prepared, they administer it to Caribert, but it has no effect, leaving Eide angered. The Traveler believes that it wasn't enough so they decide to make more. Eide has them fetch some water to grow the strange mushrooms used in the remedy. He then states that he has to leave and asks the Traveler to not let the Forest Rangers discover the place as he makes the fertilizer. Instead, Fungi appear, which the Traveler repels. As they prepare another dose of the medicine at the Statue of the Seven, Eide notices Caribert leaving and they chase after him.</p>
            <h4 align="center">A Lamenter at Fate's End</h4>
            <p>Following the hilichurl, Eide realizes that it is not Caribert as it lacks the scarf which he gave him as a gift. Nonetheless, the hilichurl's behavior was unusual and the two decide to follow it to an unknown sanctuary, discovering hilichurls praying to something. Investigating further, the two are greeted by a strange being. The Traveler recognizes it as a being of the Abyss, but is not a member of the Abyss Order. The Traveler defeats it, after which Eide expresses awe at the being's power and how the Traveler easily defeated it. When they reach the end, they find a strange object hung midair and realize that it was the same as the Defiled Statue they encountered before. The Traveler warns Eide to leave, but turns to see Eide suddenly bowing as a mysterious voice that calls itself a "sinner" begins to speak. As the voice leaves, Eide regains consciousness, awed by the experience. Disturbed, the Traveler insists that they leave and they return to his house. After receiving a second dose of the medicine, Caribert regains consciousness, but is somewhat horrified at what he became. Eide tells him that they're in a fairy tale and under no circumstances he is to take off his mask.</p>
            <p>Believing that the voice from the strange sanctuary saved his son, Eide returns to it pray, not believing the Traveler's claims that the god was actually a "sinner."</p>
            <h4 align="center">Portended Fate</h4>
            <p>Worried for his safety, the Traveler returns to the sanctuary to help clear any monsters on the way. When they return to the spot where they'd heard the voice, the statue is nowhere to be seen, and neither are any hilichurls. Eide decides to return his house, believing they would meet the strange deity again. When they arrive, they discover Caribert missing and the mirror broken on the floor. Worried that he took off his mask and saw himself in the mirror, the two try frantically to track him, running into some Forest Rangers on the way. After being sent in the right direction, they find Caribert imbued with the power of the Abyss as he takes his mask off, rendering the Traveler unconscious.</p>
            <p>Once they regain consciousness, Eide reveals himself as Chlothar Alberich and addresses the Traveler as his "Prince" or "Princess," causing the Traveler to pick up the mirror and see themselves as their sibling before falling unconscious again as Chlothar declares his intention to use the power of the Abyss to fight the gods. When they come to, they find Dainsleif and Paimon over them. Dainsleif states that the Abyss had messed with the Ley Lines in the area and he fixed it before the Traveler explains what they saw to the two. Upon digging the field, they find the remains of a man — which they believe is Chlothar, as he had disappeared 100 years after founding the Abyss Order — and a woman. Dainsleif then states that they have to part ways for now, as "he" may have seen the Traveler, referring to the "sinner" they had seen in the vision. He has his suspicions as to who this sinner is, but needs time to confirm their identity and he'll know who he is for sure in their next meeting as he leaves. The Traveler then hugs Paimon. </p>
