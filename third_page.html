                <p style="font-size: 89%;"> Albedo, also known as the Kreideprinz, is an alchemist with a huge thirst for knowledge. This has led him to the position of Chief Alchemist and Captain of the Investigation Team for the Knights of Favonius in Mondstadt. He is assisted by Sucrose and Timaeus, and loves investigating and understanding obscure knowledge from generations of scholars who came before him. Aside from this, he is also an artist and while he has illustrated Xingqiu's novels, many of his pieces are unfinished. Most of his energy is said to be spent sorting out Klee's chaos. He was recently revealed to be hiding a huge secret about his identity, one that is likely to impact future storylines.</p>

He has a steady job, a nice house and a comfortable life, with the impression given that he's been in his job for a while.This is likely due to the fact he is incredibly capable, and keeps a low profile, as well as keeping the Akademiya's secrets.

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Candace is said to be a descendant of King Deshret, blessed by the gods and tasked with being the guardian of Aaru Village. Her heterochromatic eyes make her stand out, and some have seen this as intimidating, especially when combined with her ability to harness the power of the dessert. However, Candace is incredibly kind and will help anyone in distress. She welcomes visitors and looks after all in the village. Although this kindness should not be misconstrued as weakness. Those who disobey the village rules will pay a hefty price.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 100%;">Sprout of Rebirth</p>
                <p style="font-size: 90%;">Birthday: 5/8<br>Affliation: Gandharva Ville<br>Vision: Dendro<br>Constellation: Leptailurus Cevarius<br>Height: 5'2" / 159cm<br>Weapon: Bow<br>Nation: Sumeru</p>
                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Collei was very ill as a child and was brought to a seer in an effort to save her life. The seer claimed that he had a cure for the illness, known as Eleazar, so Collei's mother handed her over to save her life. Sadly, this was a deception that resulted in Collei becoming a test subject for Fatui experiments. She eventually broke free of the Fatui, although we don't know how, and now finds herself an outcast. She's incredibly pessimistic and has a thirst for vengeance. She's thought to still be only around 16 or so, but has been under Fatui control for most of her life.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;"> For Chongyun, his positivity is all he needs to fend off whatever evil spirits lurk nearby, making him perfect for carrying on the family trade of exorcism. However, while this makes him highly effective, he's also disadvantaged. Never having actually seen an evil spirit, since they flee from his innate high spirits, he'd still rather encounter one to improve on his skill.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Cyno is a young scholar from Sumeru Akademiya who holds the position of General Mahamatra, setting consequences for those who commit academic offenses such as plagiarism. He can come across as stern or standoffish, but he is just trying to be clear and concise. Outside his academic role, which he takes very seriously, he enjoys playing TCGs, making jokes (badly), and having fun with his friends, who include Collei.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Dehya is a member of The Emerites, a Sumeru mercenary organisation. She is highly regarded as brave, strong, and fair. She will defend those who hire her, and also has a compassionate side we've seen in her story arc and interactions with Dunyarzad. While she sells her skills with a Claymore, her dignity is her own, and she conducts herself with grace and confidence. She doesn't suffer fools and isn't arrogant or impulsive, making her a formidable woman.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;"> This fiery boy with the short fuse used to be a loyal member of the Knights of Favonius. Once passionate and determined to protect Mondstadt no matter what, his internal flame flickered away after the poor handling of his father's death when he was 18. Now, he's retired as a knight and inherited the Dawn Winery from his father. He still defends Mondstadt but as a vigilante, rather than a knight.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Diona is unique in that she's a popular bartender who mixes amazing drinks, yet hates alcohol. She finds herself always mixing perfect drinks, which is both a blessing and a curse. This dislike of alcohol is likely to stem from being neglected by her father Draff during his drunken stupors. She has trace elements of non-human blood and is very protective of others. She craves friendship and is always happy to help others.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Dori is a Sumeru merchant who has a penchant for being resourceful and acquiring high quality goods of dubious origin. She vets her customers carefully and then uses her charm to persuade them to part with their Mora. While some regard her as an unscrupulous con artist, others will happily pay her high prices in order to get their hands on rare items they'd otherwise struggle to find. Dori doesn't much care about her reputation, prefering to focus on keeping herself and her clients out of trouble with the authorities while raking in the coins.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;"> Eula is a descendant of the Lawrence Clan, who once ruled over Mondstadt with an iron fist. She is described as an outstanding Spindrift Knight and is the Captain of the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company, although we are unsure how this came to be. Despite her aristocratic heritage, Eula has a very different outlook from her clan. She is one of few nobles who acknowledge that the clan's actions against Mondstadt were unjustified, causing them to consider her a traitor. Eula is free-spirited and can be a reliable ally and friend. However, many cannot forget her lineage and she struggles with being viewed in the same way.</p>

She is an investigator in the Adventurers' Guild and is always accompanied by Oz, her night raven familiar. She's been in the guild since she was 14 and enjoys speaking in increasingly complex sentences.

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Ganyu is a half-human, half-adeptus with half-qilin heritage. This means she has a range of different characteristics from both humans and Gods. She's hard-working as well as being both shy and reserved.

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Gorou is the general and leader of the resistance fighting against the Vision Hunt Decree. He's considered to be sincere, loyal and trustworthy. He speaks his mind and often fails to consider others feelings, yet others are drawn to him. He has dog blood which has given him physical animal traits, namely ears and a tail.

                <p style="font-size: 89%;"> Heizou is a detective for the Tenryou Commission in Inazuma. Although, it appears that not everyone is happy about this. Kujou Sara keeps him around since he delivers results due to his incredible intuition and logical mind, but he clashes with fellow Commission employee Thoma. This is said to be due to Heizou's rebellious nature and desire to follow his own mind, rather than any restrictions placed on him by others. While Heizou isn't the easiest person to get along with, he is cheerful and outgoing with a wild imagination. He uses untraditional methods of deduction but no one can deny that he gets results.</p>

Hu Tao likes to keep busy and is often described as eccentric. Her bizarre personality has earned her the disdain of some, including Qiqi.

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">The elegant and poised Jean Gunnhildr is already Acting Grand Master, despite being a young age. Although she got a boost from the Gunnhildr name as the eldest child and successor to the oldest family of knights in Mondstadt, her reputable reliability is definitely earned through her determination and dedication to protect the city.

                <p style="font-size: 89%;"> Xiao is an adeptus and the only remaining Yaksha of the five sent to subdue demonic spirits in Liyue. His Yaksha name is Alatus but he currently lives a solitary life under the name Xiao at the Wangshu Inn. He is polite and reserved, preferring his own company to that of others. This is because he suffers constant pain due to negative karma gained in the line of his duties which he doesn't wish to inflict upon anyone else.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;"> Xingqiu is the son of the manager of the Feiyun Commerce Guild but prefers books to commerce. He's polite, well-mannered, and often found reading or studying. This well-read youngster also has a mischievous side and longs to be one of the heroes he reads about in the books he devours. While his antics have got the guild into trouble, he always manages to talk his way out of tight spots.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;"> Xinyan is single-handedly trying to popularize rock 'n' roll in Liyue, a sound that hails from Fontaine. Music is in her soul and she frequently performs throughout Liyue Harbor. She's loud, defiant, passionate, rebellious, and everything else a great rockstar should be. Using a guitar she made herself she performs self-penned songs to anyone who will listen, bringing her sound to Liyue, one day at a time.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Yaoyao is the youngest disciple of the adeptus Streetward Rambler, more commonly known as Madame Ping. The pair act as if grandparent and grandchild, yet Yaoyao displays wisdom beyond her years under this tutelage. Talented and driven, Yaoyao often flips between mothering the other disciples, before betraying her youth through misunderstanding. Yaoyao is never without Yuegai, an adepti treasure she received from Cloud Retainer that protects her if she's in danger. All the adepti have a great affection for her and believe she has a bright future ahead.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Yae means Chief Priest and Miko is the Guuji of the Grand Narakami Shrine. We are unsure how long she has been in this role but is referred to by several Archons and described as an "old friend" of both Morax and Baal, suggesting that it is likely a long time. She is also one of Raiden Shogun's only friends, close enough for the pair to be on first name terms.We also see another side to Miko when she's running the Yae Publishing House. This feeds into her love of reading and literature in general, and being here lifts her spirits. She's a Kitsune and does have a fox form, but we have not seen this so far.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Yanfei was born to a human mother and an Adeptus father, similarly to Ganyu. When she was grown her parents set off on an adventure, leaving her under the care of Madam Ping, who knew her father. Now living in Liyue, Yanfei has built a name for herself as a highly-skilled legal advisor. Yanfei's Adeptus heritage doesn't seem to affect her. She lives her life like other humans in the city and never entered into a contract with Rex Lapis, due to being born in peacetime. She is very intelligent and knowledgeable with a strong sense of justice. The law is her passion and she has learned as much as possible about it. While she specializes in Liyue law she does have legal knowledge that spans other regions of Teyvat as well. She takes her job very seriously, and even Ningguang respects her legal knowledge.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 89%;">Yelan claims to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs but is said to have taken over the operations in the Yangshang Teahouse on the side after investigating the previous owner. The Liyue "tea shop" has incredibly bad service, and is unaccessible by players. It is used as a front for a casino that Yelan now oversees. In public, Yelan is very pleasant and polite, yet maintains an air of secrecy. She still does some work for the Ministry and her intelligence is accurate enough that Ningguang seems to tolerate her absence, while Keqing appreciates any help she can get.</p>

Her father is deaf but she still loves to talk to him about the store, which she runs with the same attention to detail that he did.

Yoimaya is also known for being disorganized at times and also quite reckless but she has plenty of people willing to help her out.</p>
