      <p>Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed by miHoYo, published by miHoYo in mainland China and by HoYoverse worldwide. It was released for Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows in 2020, on PlayStation 5 in 2021, and is set for release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics through which players can obtain new characters and weapons. The base game is expanded regularly through patches using the games as a service model.</p>
      <p>Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler journeys throughout Tevyat in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon, becoming involved in the affairs of its nations along the way.</p>
      <p>Development of Genshin Impact began in 2017; the game received generally positive reviews, with critics writing positively of its combat mechanics and its immersive open world. Conversely, some criticism was aimed at its simplistic endgame and its monetization model. It had a first-year launch revenue of more than $3 billion in its first year of release, the highest for any video game, and a revenue of more than $4 billion as of March 2022</p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>

      <p>Genshin Impact is an open-world, action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party. Switching between characters can be done quickly during combat, allowing the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks. Characters may have their abilities enhanced in various ways, mainly through directly leveling them up and improving the artifacts and weapons that a character can equip. In addition to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are bosses and challenges that reward highly valuable resources, but claiming them uses up a currency called Original Resin, which slowly regenerates over time. Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level. The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the rarity of rewards that defeating them gives.</p>
      <p>The player can control their character and perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding, all limited by stamina. Some characters possess abilities that can alter the environment, such as freezing water to create an ice path that can aid the player in traversing terrain. Many teleportation nodes exist throughout the world that players can warp to as a form of fast travel; among these are landmarks known as Statues of The Seven that can heal and revive characters, and provide benefits such as increasing player stamina. Items such as food and ore may be procured from the open world, while enemies and treasure chests drop other types of resources that may be used in enhancing a character's strength. Players can obtain food from hunting animals, gathering fruit and vegetables, or purchasing them from in-game shops. Furthermore, there are special battle instances called "Domains" that reward materials which increase character and weapon strength. Meals cooked from ingredients gathered in the overworld may also provide desirable effects, such as regenerating characters' health or boosting various stats. Players can also procure ore that can be refined and then used to create weapons or enhance their strength.</p>
      <p>A multiplayer mode is available in the form of co-op. Up to four players can play together in the overworld and join Domains. Player matching can either be done by requesting to connect with another player, or through an automatic search. The game features cross-platform play, so players on any platform can play with each other.</p>
      <p>By completing certain quests early in the game, the player can unlock four additional playable characters. Most characters, however, are obtained through the character banners of the game's gacha system, called "Wishes," or through limited-time events. Several premium in-game currencies, obtainable through in-app purchases or as gameplay rewards, are required to pull on the game's banners. A pity system guarantees that the player will receive rare items after a set number of pulls.k </p>

      <h2>Elemental Combat</h2>
      <hr>

      <p>Playable characters have control over one of seven natural elements: Anemo (air), Geo (earth), Pyro (fire), Hydro (water), Cryo (ice), Electro (electricity), and Dendro (plant life). These elements react with one another to produce various effects. For instance, if a Hydro attack hits a target, the enemy will be inflicted with the "Wet" status effect, and if they are hit with a subsequent Cryo attack, these two status effects combine to freeze the opponent, temporarily preventing them from performing any actions. Some sets of elemental reactions – such as those of Dendro – are more complex than others. Elemental reactions are an essential mechanic in the game's combat.</p>
      <p>Each character also has two unique combat abilities: an Elemental Skill and an Elemental Burst. Elemental Skills are attacks with a set cooldown that can be used at any time, while Elemental Bursts are ultimate attacks with an energy cost. These require the player to amass sufficient elemental energy in order to use them. Manipulating the game's elements through the Skills and Bursts of a given party's four characters to produce various reactions is a core feature of its gameplay. Certain elemental abilities are also required to solve puzzles within the overworld.</p>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Genshin Impact began development as early as late January 2017, with an initial team of 120 people, which grew to 400 by the end of that year, and reached 700 by February 2021. miHoYo revealed the game in June 2019 at E3 2019. The game was developed using the Unity Engine. The game had a development and marketing budget of around $100 million, making it one of the most expensive video games to develop. Between the announcement and release closed beta tests were held, allowing invited players to explore and interact with the open world. The game includes voice-overs in four languages, and 15 different languages for text</p>
      <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is held in high regard by the development team, and is cited as one of the main inspirations for Genshin Impact. Development was aimed at making the game different and fun from other MMORPGs in terms of its quest and combat systems as well as its random events and mode of exploration. The game was designed to be cross-platform as developing the game for PC and console allowed the developers to raise graphical fidelity for the game, such as rendering realistic shadows</p>
      <p>The overall artistic vision of the game was intended to combine an anime style with more key elements from real-world cultures, and each nation is based on a region of the world: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Japanese-inspired nation of Inazuma (稲妻, lightning) is an archipelago island nation that is ruled by a shogun named after Japan's god of lightening, and is initially encountered as a closed-off nation.</li>
        <li>Sumeru, named after Mount Meru and ancient Sumer, is based off the cultures of the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, and consists of rainforests and deserts.</li>
        <li>Liyue (璃月, jade moon) combines various eras of China's history into one region, and reimagines Chinese culture through a fantasy perspective. The nation's map was also inspired by Chinese geographic locations, such as Zhangjiajie National Forest Park and Tianmen Mountain.</li>
        <li>Natlan is likely named after the legendary homeland of the Aztecs, Aztlán, and is inspired by the cultures of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.</li>
        <li>The remaining major nations are influenced by Western cultures and styles: Mondstadt (moon city in German) is based off traditional high fantasy, Fontaine (fountain in French) seems to be influenced by steampunk and the Belle Époque, and Snezhnaya (Снежная, snowy) takes inspiration from both Soviet-era and Imperial Russia.</li>
        <li>Though its name most likely derives from Arabic (خائن رياح, betrayer of wind), Khaenri'ah is mainly based on Germanic and Nordic mythology.</li>
        <li>Teyvat takes its name from the Hebrew word for "ark" (תֵּבַת, tēḇâ).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The game's primary mythological basis is Gnosticism, particularly the way it understands relationships between humans and their world, and how gods may influence this relationship. The name given to Tevyat's gods, "archons," are named for related deities within Gnosticism. Although each Archon has a separate name for their human form and is referred to with a specific title by the citizens of their nation, most gods in the game's story – even those who are not Archons – take the names of demons from the Ars Goetia, the first volume of The Lesser Key of Solomon. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Music</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Yu-Peng Chen of HOYO-MiX composed the game's original score, which was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. The approach to creating the soundtrack is to immerse players within the game, and provide emotional and beautiful melodies. Based upon a foundation of Western music, the score also has regional and cultural influences added depending upon the region. For example, in Mondstadt, Chen used woodwind instruments to reflect Mondstadt's association with wind and freedom. In contrast, the battle themes use polyphony and other composing techniques, as well as mimicking orchestration elements from composers such as Beethoven. Several soundtrack albums featuring music about characters and regions of the game have been released periodically. For his work on the soundtrack Chen was awarded the "Outstanding Artist—Newcomer/Breakthrough" at the 2020 Annual Game Music Awards. In an interview published in April 2021 Chen expressed interest in releasing the soundtracks on CD, as well as hosting concerts in the future. The first concert was held virtually on October 3, 2021, titled "Melodies of an Endless Journey" and featured multiple bands and an orchestra performing various soundtracks from the game. A second virtual concert was held on February 4, 2022, titled "Reflections of Spring" featuring the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra performing soundtracks from the Liyue region</p>

      <h2>Release</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>The worldwide release, September 28, 2020, was announced on August 17 for PC and mobile platforms, and on August 28, it was revealed that the PlayStation 4 version was released on the same date.[84][85] The game was made available on PlayStation 5 through backwards compatibility on November 11. On April 28, 2021, the PlayStation 5 version of the game was released, featuring enhanced visuals, improved loading times, and DualSense controller support. A Nintendo Switch version is in development, though no release window has been announced. Prior to its release the game had over 10 million registrations, with over half of that from outside China. According to some, the game was the biggest international release of any Chinese video game. In the lead up to release, the game won the Tokyo Game Show Media Awards 2020 public poll, ranking first among 14 other games.</p>
